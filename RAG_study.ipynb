Backstreet Boys had more albums and more songs that charted in the top 10 in the Billboard Hot 100. Backstreet Boys also had more worldwide popularity, especially in Japan. \\n\\nOn the other hand, NSync had two of the fastest-selling albums of all time, and their three albums were considered pop perfection. NSync also had a surprise reunion in 2013, which caused a media frenzy.

We remember the Nineties' definitive boy-band feud. Getty (2)\\n\\nIn the 2015 Backstreet Boys documentary Show ‘Em What You’re Made Of, a single telling scene sums up the strange tension that arose between two of the biggest-selling boy bands of all time.\\n\\n“It was almost like a betrayal,” Kevin Richardson recalled in the doc, looking back at the moment in 1995 when the Boys’ founder and label CEO Lou Pearlman showed Richardson a VHS recording of the newly formed ‘N Sync showcasing their abilities.\\n\\n“When we started out, we were like, ‘Yeah, we’re a team. We’re gonna take over the world. There’s nobody like us,'” he continued. “Then you find out, ‘Well, actually there is somebody like you.'”\\n\\nIn the mid-Nineties, there was an absence of big-name pop groups marketed to teens. Eighties heartthrobs New Kids on the Block were rocked with post–Milli Vanilli lip-sync allegations, and even grunge was on the way out, as drug-fueled turmoil led to the loss of the genre’s biggest star.\\n\\nBut Pearlman, a man with a history of insurance fraud, was inspired by the NKOTB model. He placed an ad in the Orlando Sentinel for vocalists to form a pop group, leading to the founding of Backstreet Boys in 1993. Just as BSB began breaking internationally, however, Pearlman did something unexpected: He created his own boy band’s stiffest competition.\\n\\n“[We] used to joke all the time that we were going to turn Orlando into the next Motown, but we were going to call it Snowtown – because we weren’t doing it with R&B acts, we were doing it with pop acts,” ‘N Sync and Backstreet Boys manager Johnny Wright told Rolling Stone in 1998. Wright had once been NKOTB’s road manager and was brought on to work with Pearlman’s budding stars.\\n\\n“I guess you could say Backstreet Boys are the Temptations and ‘N Sync are the Four Tops,” he elaborated.\\n\\nLike BSB, ‘N Sync launched in Europe first. They began releasing singles in Germany in 1996 and became megastars across the continent seemingly overnight. It wasn’t until March of 1998 that the group officially dropped their self-titled debut album in the U.S. – a full year after it was released in European markets. They trimmed the original track list – which included an a cappella cover of Boston’s “More Than a Feeling” – but it’s still an album washed in the EuroDance sound favored by their camp of Swedish songwriters and producers.\\n\\nEvery Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term\\n\\nThe 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\n\\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\n\\nThe 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History\\n\\nPrior to ‘N Sync‘s 1998 release, Backstreet Boys had just cracked the code. While not yet the phenomenon they would become with 1999’s Millennium, they did make it to Number Four with their self-titled U.S. debut in January 1998. But the market was starting to make space for a second boy band: ‘N Sync’s U.S. debut would finally hit Number Two in October of that year, spurred on by an MTV concert special in July that sent singles like “I Want You Back” and “(God Must Have Spent) a Little More Time on You” rising up the charts.\\n\\n“The ultimate goal was to do it not once but twice,” Wright said in 1998. “With ‘N Sync at Number Three in this country, I think we’ve done that. And, obviously, it’s caused a problem.”\\n\\nBackstreet Boys ended up leaving Wright’s Backstreet Management that fall. During the following few years, both boy bands would end up entangled in lawsuits with Pearlman, claiming misrepresentation and fraud over their lack of earnings. While such legal battles would slow most artists down, by 2000, both groups were at the head of an international pop phenomenon.\\n\\nWhile the two boy bands worked together to fight for the money that was stolen from them, the fans fueled a rivalry. Pearlman, whether accidentally or on purpose, created the Beatles vs. Stones of the new millennium as the groups raced to become bigger than one another.\\n\\n“It’s not ‘N Sync itself but where ‘N Sync comes from that digs me, digs me, digs me – and gets me, still to this day,” Richardson told Rolling Stone in 2000, mirroring the same thing sentiment he would express in the doc. “I’d lost my father to cancer. So I looked at Lou like a father figure. But I was naïve, and he’s a liar. We’ll always remember him for helping us get started. But we’ll also remember him for screwing us blind and building another group behind our backs.”\\n\\n‘N Sync felt less of that bitterness toward the Backstreet Boys. After all, they did follow their lead. “People try to make a feud out of everything,” Justin Timberlake told Rolling Stone in 1998. “And we didn’t see it like that.”\\n\\nStill, the comparisons were never-ending. On a technical level, Backstreet Boys sold more albums, but ‘N Sync created a star even bigger than either boy band in Timberlake. The “rivalry” also bred more competition, leading to an unprecedented wave of more male vocal groups, like 98 Degrees and the reality-show–made O-Town. None made it as far and most were also fighting for money Pearlman stole from them.\\n\\n50 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time\\n\\nKelly Clarkson Enters 'Trolls' Land With ’NSync Cover\\n\\nLike all teen movements, the stars and fans grew up. ‘N Sync went on “hiatus” to pursue solo projects, and the Backstreet Boys saw the darker side of fame consume members like AJ McLean, who went to rehab in 2001. Timberlake’s solo career took off soon after, and the boy bands’ all-grown-up peers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera – two artists also pitted against each other in a pop feud during that era – were eager to show off a less squeaky-clean side of their images.\\n\\nSince the heyday of ‘N Sync and the Backstreet Boys, teen-pop eras have come and gone every few years. The Jonas Brothers went fairly unchallenged as their female Disney counterparts grappled over Britney and Christina’s crowns. Later, One Direction would go head-to-head with the Wanted in a lopsided feud that was as much fan-created as band-perpetuated. More recently, a new crop of boy bands like Why Don’t We and PrettyMuch have filled the vacuum left by One Direction’s absence, but a rivalry has yet to fully materialize.\\n\\nTo this day, the ‘N Sync–Backstreet Boys rift continues to define the groups’ respective legacies. (Recently, the old rivalry was rekindled in decidedly jokey fashion when ‘N Sync’s Joey Fatone claimed that his group could “probably kick [Backstreet Boys’] ass” in basketball.) And while, back in the day, the artists might not have been thrilled by the competition, like all great celebrity beefs, it only helped to propel each group higher into the pop stratosphere.\\n\\nThe Avett Brothers Musical 'Swept Away' Heads to Broadway This Fall\\n\\nCarín León Unveils 'Boca Chueca Vol. 1' Tracklist Featuring Kane Brown, Leon Bridges, Bolela\\n\\nShellac's 'To All Trains' Perfectly Balances Steve Albini's Sarcasm With Biting Noise Rock\\n\\nLenny Kravitz Schedules 'Blue Electric Light' Las Vegas Residency\\n\\nVince Staples Launches New Album 'Dark Times' With First Single 'Shame on the Devil'\\n\\nPersonal Achievement\\n\\nLarisha Paul Read more\\n\\nThe Avett Brothers Musical 'Swept Away' Heads to Broadway This Fall\\n\\nCarín León Unveils 'Boca Chueca Vol. 1' Tracklist Featuring Kane Brown, Leon Bridges, Bolela\\n\\nJulian Assange Allowed to Appeal U.S. Extradition\\n\\nLenny Kravitz Schedules 'Blue Electric Light' Las Vegas Residency\\n\\nThe digital daily newsletter\\n\\nA Cultural Force That\\n\\nTranscends Generations\\n\\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

It is a question that has haunted boy band fans for darn near 20 years. BSB and *N SYNC happen to be two of the most successful pop groups of all time, but because their most dominant runs happened concurrently, the pair of quintets will forever be compared. Looking back on their heydays 15 years later, it’s easy to love both groups — but, inevitably, it’s just as easy to lean toward one or the other, and pledge an unspoken allegiance to either Backstreet or the asterisk.\\n\\nA Feid and Yandel Surprise Show On The Water, With an Abrupt Ending 05/15/2024\\n\\nSee latest videos, charts and news\\n\\nSee latest videos, charts and news\\n\\nToday, those unspoken allegiances become spoken, as Billboard pop editors Jason Lipshutz and Erin Strecker face off to explain why Backstreet Boys were better than *N SYNC, and vice versa. Whose side are you on? Read the debate and sound off in the comments section below.\\n\\nTop 20 Essential Boy Band Songs | 10 K-Pop Boy Bands You Need To Know \\n\\nJASON: Okay before we begin, Erin, full disclosure: we both wholeheartedly love the music of Backstreet Boys and *N SYNC. I am not an *N SYNC hater in any regard — who could ever hate the reason that the name “Chris Kirkpatrick” is forever burned into our brains? — and I know that the shape of your heart is geometrically accustomed to include lots of BSB love. There is no “last place” in this competition, only second place.\\n\\nAnd we are both positive that we know which quintet belongs in first place. I know you have no doubt in your mind that *N SYNC was the superior turn-of-the-millennium boy band, in the same way that I cannot fathom giving anyone other than Brian, A.J., Nick, Howie and Kevin the modern boy band crown.\\n\\nI watched MTV’s Total Request Live every day after school for years beginning at the end of 1998, basking in the mayhem of Times Square and Carson Daly’s black nail polish. There were big hits that devoured their TRL competition in those first few months — “…Baby One More Time,” of course, and I see you, Kid Rock’s “Bawitdaba”! — but when the video for Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way” came out in April 1999, it felt like the teen-pop tsunami that had been gathering for months had finally crashed ashore.\\n\\nThe word “iconic” gets tossed around too much by modern music fans, but everything about the “I Want It That Way” song and video felt instantly iconic: that opening couplet, the powder-white suits, the way A.J. lurches his body forward during “It’s too-o-o la-ate!”, the “Kisses For Kevin” sign being waved around during the final chorus. Everything about the construction of “I Want It That Way” and its video is so simple, so clean, and yet so memorable, that whenever anyone brings up the boy-band era of the late 90’s/early 00’s, my mind immediately goes to that one song — and by extension, the feeling of watching it on TRL, of the day Millennium came out, of realizing that these dudes were rock stars in a way that 11-year-old me never imagined rock stars could be.\\n\\nSo I guess that’s where my argument starts: you can keep your “Bye Bye Bye” and “It’s Gonna Be Me,” because to me, “I Want It That Way” was unequivocally the high point of that boy band era. It’s the boy band song that people who hate boy bands still admit is pretty great. It’s my fire; my one desire. Is it not yours, Erin? If not, tell me why.\\n\\nThe Evolution of Boy Bands, From The Osmonds to Zayn Malik: A Timeline\\n\\nERIN: Wow, you’re really tearin’ up my heart here, Jason.\\n\\nFirst of all, I want to second your point that we’re both fans of both bands (and I’ve had this debate at previous jobs as well). Anyone who isn’t currently in a 7th grade IM war can admit that the bands are of course very similar, both contributing to the apex of teen pop at the turn of the millennium. SPEAKING OF… I rocked out hard to Millennium, and Backstreet Boys was one of the first albums I ever bought. I was pretty sure I was going to marry Nick Carter for a time, so on a deep emotional level I understand where you’re coming from.\\n\\nBut. BUT. To dub Backstreet Boys the preeminent boy band of the era is a mistake on par with walking out of the house in matching all-denim outfits with your significant other. Sure, *N SYNC didn’t give their fans as many albums as Backstreet Boys did theirs, but the three they did put out were pop perfection: tight harmonies, catchy choruses, and iconic music videos full of dance moves still so instantly recognizable that one need only move their arm in a horizontal motion across their body while bringing their fingers and thumb together and apart to elicit approval at any bar or karaoke situation in which one might find themselves.\\n\\n*N SYNC showed they were equally adept at stirring ballads (“God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You”) as well as upbeat dance tracks (“No Strings Attached”). For me, that’s a significant *N SYNC edge: Backstreet Boys may be able to harmonize with the best of them, but — barring the excellent “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)” — their dance tracks fall short. We aren’t deciding who are the best technical singers, we’re going for overall impact, and from the costumes to the stage show (THEY PRETENDED TO BE DOCTORS), *NSYNC checks every box.\\n\\n“I Want It That Way” is an excellent song, no argument here. But I would argue that its the high point for the band; a level they don’t get quite as close to again. *N SYNC was able to sustain their incredible run for quite some time, from “Tearin’ Up My Heart” to “It’s Gonna Be Me” to “Pop.” At this point, quite frankly, all that matters is that you recognize that it’s just about respect.\\n\\nJASON: “Their dance tracks fall short”??? What about “We’ve Got It Goin’ On,” “The Call,” “Larger Than Life”? And, sorry, the “Bye Bye Bye” dance can’t hold a candle to the “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)” two-handed body pull.\\n\\nI understand that BSB and *N SYNC each released three albums during the heights of their cultural popularity, but I think there’s something to be said about the longevity of the Backstreet Boys. Would an *N SYNC tour in 2015 draw more attention than a BSB tour in 2015? No question, because of the prolonged dormancy and Justin Timberlake’s involvement. However, Backstreet Boys have been steadily entertaining audiences for a decade longer than *N SYNC, and while radio hasn’t cared about the four albums they’ve released since 2005, there are some absolute gems in there if you look hard enough, first and foremost the incredible power ballad “Incomplete.”\\n\\nNeil Young once sang, “It’s better to burn out than to fade away,” and while *N SYNC arguably burned brighter than the Backstreet Boys (at least in terms of album sales), Backstreet Boys have kept chugging along without fading away (at least in terms of live performances). BSB still sells out shows! And I know they do so because of their hits from 15 years ago, but they’ve been putting in the work and delighting people past their prime in a way I cannot help but admire.\\n\\nERIN: I give Backstreet Boys credit for their longevity, but I think the fact that radio hasn’t cared since 2005 means that the overall quality has waned and their present-day concerts are merely a shadow of their former ones.\\n\\nWe’re getting into a very intriguing hypothetical here, because this is where the argument gets interesting, right? What would a 2015 *N SYNC look like? (Hopefully a little more exciting than the all-too-brief VMAs reunion of 2013). It’s impossible to say for sure, but I, for one, would certainly pay to watch Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick and of course Justin Timberlake break out their biggest hits. They were moving in an interesting direction before the indefinite hiatus — “Gone” and other Celebrity songs pointed to a new, mature sound (look what One Direction is currently doing as they grow).\\n\\nIf a fourth *N SYNC album had happened, would it have been more of the same, or would it possibly have taken the best of Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds and melded that with a group dynamic? I don’t want to argue for a world where FutureSex/LoveSounds doesn’t exist (I’m not a maniac), but it’s certainly intriguing to think about what an alternate universe with Timberlake and the collaborators he subsequently worked with would do with *N SYNC. It’s all I’ve ever wanted.\\n\\nSpeaking of Justin, he’s the curly blonde Ken doll in the room here. We simply can’t have a conversation about best boy bands of that era without acknowledging that there was one incredible performer who rose above it all. A consummate showman who is now in a boy band alum stratosphere all by himself, Timberlake’s star power elevated everything around it, from cheesy music videos to charming interviews — even his teenage dream tabloid romance with Britney Spears contributed to a zeitgeist that simply paid more attention to *N SYNC than Backstreet.\\n\\nNumbers aren’t everything, but I’ll leave you with one quick stat: Between 2000 and 2009, the top-selling album was The Beatles’ 1. Number 2? No Strings Attached. For a time *N SYNC wasn’t simply a big thing in pop culture, they were pop culture.\\n\\nJASON: Justin Timberlake is one of my favorite artists, and the first six songs on FutureSex/LoveSounds probably represent the best six-song run on any album released last decade. JC Chasez is someone whose voice, music and hair I will always defend as underrated, and “Blowin’ Me Up (With Her Love)” is for SURE on my wedding playlist. Lance Bass and Joey Fatone starred in On The Line, so they are golden in my eyes. Chris Kirkpatrick? Dreads, the Eminem diss, three first names composing his name. Perfection.\\n\\nThe members of *N SYNC are more singular than the members of Backstreet Boys, there’s no denying that. But that’s sort of the point, isn’t it? BSB have always been a unit — they can’t operate without each other, and those two Kevin-free albums are their worst for a reason. I don’t necessarily think that a group needs flashy personalities to put on a great show or make great music, and when you listen to the Backstreet Boys harmonize or watch them do their “Backstreet’s Back” dance, there’s a certain cohesion that remains irreplaceable. *N SYNC songs are more or less just JC Chasez & Justin Timberlake songs, with backing harmonies on the chorus. The five Backstreet Boys balance each other out — everything is in its right place, to paraphrase Radiohead.\\n\\nTo respond to your final point — it’s true, No Strings Attached is more massive than any Backstreet Boys album. You know what else though? No Strings Attached has “Digital Get Down,” which is the ickiest boy band song this side of “Liquid Dreams.” Yuuuuuuuuck.\\n\\nERIN: Don’t bring up On The Line trying to distract me. I see you, Jason, and I won’t stand for it.\\n\\nLook, is “Digital Get Down” Grammy-worthy? Of course not. But it is an oddly specific throwaway song about a time (the dawn of the Internet age) and place (your house, chatting with your crush). I don’t want to put too fine a point on it, but did Lance Bass introduce teenage America to sexting? Would Catfish exist if not for this tune? OMG, I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE HECK BRITNEY SPEARS THINKS OF THIS SONG.\\n\\nIn all seriousness, I guess my final argument is simply that *N SYNC perfected the boy band formula that had been done before and would continue to be done again and again. They had the moves, the cheese, the personalities, the songs (both ballad and dance club-worthy), and zeitgeist-y media attention. By only releasing three full-length albums, they retained a higher quality that the Boys’ albums began to lose. That *N SYNC eschewed the reunion tour game only allowed them to burn brighter in fans’ mind, as you say, but it also allows fans remember, untainted, the joy of learning to dance like them, a time where “Bringin Da Noise” could soundtrack a hangout, and “This I Promise You” could appear on a mixtape from a junior high crush. The music is important, but a perfect boy band is all about the feelings said songs provoke: of hope, of fantasy, of fun. Cue up the opening notes of “Pop” and you’re instantly transported back to 2001, ready to take on the world (ideally with Mr. Timberlake by your side).\\n\\nAlso, I mean, in a music video *N SYNC once hung out in a mental hospital (not to mention that time they ran atop a moving train). Game, set, match.\\n\\nJASON: All fair points, but your argument also leads me right back to mine: *N SYNC may had better moves, cooler personalities and tastier cheese, but I think BSB had the better songs, and that it’s not a particularly close competition.\\n\\nLet’s break it down album by album, at least for the first three. BSB’s self-titled album had “We’ve Got It Goin’ On,” “Quit Playing Games (With My Heart),” “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back),” “As Long As You Love Me,” “All I Have to Give” and “I’ll Never Break You Heart.” Compare that to *N SYNC’s self-titled, which had “Tearin’ Up My Heart,” “Here We Go,” “I Want You Back,” “(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You” and “I Drive Myself Crazy.” Both albums are brimming with hits, but come on, Erin. “All I Have To Give” is amazing, and it’s, like, the fourth best single on Backstreet Boys!\\n\\nThen you have Millennium vs. No Strings Attached. “I Want It That Way,” “Larger Than Life” and “Show Me The Meaning of Being Lonely” vs. “Bye Bye Bye,” “It’s Gonna Be Me,” “This I Promise You.” This is a closer competition, but “I Want It That Way” is unbeatable, “Larger Than Life” is the best classic rock single of 1999 and the “Show Me The Meaning of Being Lonely” is the most unintentionally hilarious music video ever made. Game, set, Millennium.\\n\\nThen there’s Black & Blue vs. Celebrity. Look, “Pop” is my favorite *N SYNC song, “Gone” is probably my second-favorite, and “Girlfriend” has that red-hot Nelly remix. That trio is pretty tough to top! But here’s the thing, Erin: “The Call,” from BSB’s Black & Blue, is better than all of those songs. Especially the Neptunes remix, featuring Clipse! “The Call” is so overdramatic, immaculately produced and gleeful to perform at a karaoke bar at 2:00 AM, when your battery actually is low. Throw in “Shape of My Heart” and “More Than That,” and I think I’d still opt to pick up a copy of Black & Blue than Celebrity.\\n\\nIf Backstreet Boys Music > *N SYNC Music, I can only conclude than BSB > *N SYNC. We can agree on one thing at least: that era of boy bands was impossibly fun to live through.\\n\\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox Sign Up\\n\\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\\n\\nGet in the know on Visit Billboard Pro for music business news\\n\\nCher Turns Back Time on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Slam, Warns She’ll ‘Have Some Words to Say’ At Induction\\n\\nStray Kids Confirm 2024 Tour Dates, Perform ‘Lose My Breath’ on ‘Good Morning America’\\n\\nOffset Gifts Cardi B With Three Icy Chains & Bouquets of Flowers for Mother’s Day\\n\\nKelly Clarkson Talks Losing ‘A Lot’ of Weight on Prescription Medication: ‘Everybody Thinks It’s Ozempic, But It’s Not’\\n\\nTravis Kelce’s Teammate Harrison Butker Criticizes Working Women While Quoting Taylor Swift Song\\n\\nA daily briefing on what matters in the music industry\\n\\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

The boyband era essentially lasted from 97-02, with its peak being 99-00. The Backstreet Boys ruled the early part, 97-99. 1999 was their year. Milenium was the highest selling album of 1999. They were the biggest music group in the world.\\n\\nNSYNC actually surpassed BSB in popularity in 00-02. They didn\\'t just have a few hits. \"Bye Bye Bye\" was arguably the biggest song in 2000. No Strings Attached was the highest selling album of 2000, and outsold Black and Blue. NSYNC also had a year of success after BSB went on hiatus. Celebrity was a big album and BSB had no answer for it. They had the last big boyband hit with \"Girlfriend\" in 2002. Then Justin Timberlake went on to become a superstar solo artist while Nick\\'s album failed.\\n\\nIn North America, NSYNC were true rivals for BSB. Worldwide, BSB wins no contest. For example, BSB was massive in Japan while NSYNC only had decent success.\\n\\nThis exactly. I couldn\\'t name you a single song by Westlife or Boyzone (hadn\\'t even heard of Boyzone until this post, tbh)\\n\\nThis is exactly why BSB is the biggest boy band. In North America it\\'s BSB vs NSYNC while the rest of the world it\\'s BSB vs Westlife.\\n\\nNope, try Take That at the beginning and 5ive at their peak\\n\\nThat that was never that big outside of the UK and EU. In many parts of the world they\\'re a one hit wonder with Back For Good. 5ive had a few hit songs but never did dominate the scene the way BSB and Westlife did.\\n\\nTrue, but westlife didnt even take half of the level of fame take that did, that\\'s Why I mentioned it\\n\\nmore replies More replies\\n\\nTake That was big in Asia.\\n\\nTake that were the worst band ever and 5ive is irrelevant compared to west life\\n\\nTake That topples Westlife in sales in UK. They are both UK based boy bands. Take That is huge in UK and in Europe.\\n\\nmore replies More replies More replies More replies\\n\\nNot true. Westlife is only popular in United Kingdom and some parts of Asia like Southeast Asia and Africa. In North America such US and Canada and in Oceania like Australia and New Zealand, Westlife is virtually unknown. Actually, even in Europe, Westlife is not well known even though they are European themselves. That\\'s the reason they only hold concerts mostly in UK not in other parts of Europe.\\n\\nWestlife and Boyzone have no relevance in North America.\\n\\nIirc Westlife did released a US version for their debut album, and later tried to get into the US market with World Of Our Own, but boy band craze has already faded by then in the US.\\n\\nHaving said that, I think it\\'s interesting that both BSB and Nsync first gained their popularity in Europe. Or more specifically, was it Germany?\\n\\nEven in Europe specifically in Germany, NSync never came close to BSB\\'s popularity.\\n\\nI\\'m only referring to the fact that they both released their debut album in Europe before they went home to the US. I\\'m just presenting a fact and I\\'m not arguing their popularity.\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nNot true. No Strings Attached only sold 14 million and Black and Blue sold 24 million. No Strings Attached is NOT the number 1 highest album of 2000 like you claimed. Its only number #6. BSB\\'s Black and Blue is number #4 highest selling album of 2000. The number #1 highest selling album of 2000 is Marshall Mathers LP of Eminem.\\n\\nSecondly, NSync was only popular in US, not in the whole North America and certainly not in all other parts of the world. In Canada for example, BSB reigned supreme even in early 2000\\'s. Maybe,in 2000\\'s, NSync had overtaken BSB a little in terms of popularity but that\\'s only in United States.\\n\\nThe biggest song of 2000 is Bye Bye Bye? Maybe in US, but not for the rest of the world.\\n\\nI\\'m from Asia and the only hits that NSync had were This I Promise You, Its Gotta Be Me and Bye Bye Bye. And NSync was not so popular here. Out of all the 90\\'s and 00\\'s boy bands, its BSB who was the most famous boy band. Most Asians knew about NSync only in early 2000\\'s. Me personally, I thought they were a new boy band of the 2000. I never knew that they were BSB\\'s \"rival\". Most people don\\'t even know NSync and are just familiar with Justin Timberlake because of Britney Spears. Lol\\n\\nIn US, BSB and NSync were almost on equal standing. But for the rest of the world, its has always been Backstreet Boys who was the biggest boy band in the world, in Asia, North and South America, Europe, Oceania and Africa.\\n\\nImaginaryBenefit8420\\n\\nI always felt Nsync lacked putting out good ALBUMS. The ONLY reason NO strings beat Black and Blue was because of Bye Bye Bye which is pretty much the ONLY song people know them for. Black and Blue was a much better ALBUM as a whole while No strings just had the song of the year on it which is why it was bought more. Backstreet are also the ONLY boy band to be able to chart top in the U.S in 3 different decades which says something! With most artists when they are hot the first time usually that is the MOST success they will see. There are not very many artists or groups that can chart especially number 1 out of their prime!!!\\n\\nTearing up my heart and here we go are bops.\\n\\nI remember dancing bye bye bye as a kid on a cruise ship in 2000. They were huge.\\n\\nNahh bsb has like 30 hits n n sync has like 5\\n\\nI would sad new kids on the block started the Boy band Craze, well before the Backstreet Boys are in Nsync. Furthermore, I think the Beatles are probably the original boy band. Apologies for punctuation, as I was dictating.\\n\\nEqual-Technology4163\\n\\nBorn in ‘90 so BSB and NSYNC were actual childhood. I would say — each had 5 guys. Both formed in Orlando. Both very Disney World esque. Both extremely catchy songs and poppy. I could go on and on!! Oh and wasn’t NSYNC legit formed to rival them?? Just my 2 cents 😆\\n\\nBut their so called \"rivalry\" is only in US. Outside US, BSB always wins. BSB has no other \"rivals\" actually. I am from Asia, and I just recently know about BSB-NSync rivalry. Its funny because, 98° and OTown were more popular in Asia than NSync during that time. lol\\n\\nPuzzleheaded-Hair230\\n\\nThe “superiority” of the BS Boys in relation to their *NSYNC “rivals” (🙄) is reflected only commercially, in sales, but not in musical (and choreographic) quality: notice also the vast superiority of *NSYNC [notably through Dr Justin Timberlake💘, Hon DMus (Berklee, 2019)], in the amount and kinds of artistic/musical awards received, especially from MTV, that are determined by experts & connoisseurs, and not by cash registers. 🙃\\n\\nNot exactly a rivalry behind the scenes. Both bands were developed by Lou Perlman, who saw the potential of nsync after making bank with BSB, and signed them too. Fun fact, both bands eventually sued him for fraud - taking advantage of them (kids) with wild contracts that paid him as manager, producer, and even as a “sixth” member of the band. Other than those who have gone onto have additional careers (Justin T…), none of Nsync or BSBs made much money from their success…\\n\\nTwo words: Lou Pearlman\\n\\nBecause BSB and *NSYNC were the two biggest boybands at the time. The other boybands were nowhere near as popular as those two. And as previously stated, *NSYNC was literally created to rival BSB.\\n\\nNSync was never one of the \"biggest\" boybands. BSB was the biggest boyband all throughout the world. But in some continent or region, there was a boyband who was considered as BSB\\'s rival. For US, its BSB. In early 2000, in Southeast Asia, its Westlife. In other parts of the world, BSB has no rivals. But interestingly, whoever boy band that was pitted against BSB, BSB always emerges as winners in terms of popularity and sales.\\n\\nStrict_Education4872\\n\\nWhat about New kids on the block?\\n\\nFirst of all No Strings Attached was the fastest selling album in the US (2.4 million in the 1st week iirc), so there\\'s that. But aside from that, I can think of several other reasons:\\n\\nNsync was the only US-based teen pop boy band that became as successful as BSB. Westlife and BoyZone were UK-based; 98 Degrees was more adult contemporary, so they were not directly competing against BSB. O-Town tried to follow the same formula but never became as successful.\\n\\nBSB\\'s music catalogue consisted of both up-tempo tracks and ballads. Westlife and BoyZone were almost entirely ballad-centric. Nsync on the other hand, while most of their songs were up-tempo, they also had some popular ballads, which makes them somewhat \\'the best competitor\\' against BSB.\\n\\nBoth Nsync and BSB had hit singles produced by Max Martin, and both were signed to Jive Records.\\n\\nOr maybe, the record executives simply advertised them as \\'the best rival\\' because that would generate some buzz and boost the sales of both bands.\\n\\nNSYNC was the only US-based boyband that\\'s became as successful as BSB in North America. They\\'re nowhere as popular in the rest of the world. In my part of the world they were on par with 5ive.\\n\\nIn China Nsync was only slightly behind BSB and Westlife, and definitely miles ahead of 5ive.\\n\\n5ive was actually my favorite though, and I did manage to get a couple of my highschool friends into 5ive. Too bad the guys didn\\'t get along very well with each other.\\n\\nThey had great songs! IMO, some of the catchiest ones. Why didn’t the guys get along? I know they’re making music again but only three of them.\\n\\nI really loved all three of their albums in the 00s. They were somewhat advertised as the \\'bad-boy\\' boy band, and I think the hip-hop element made them unique. Back in high school I really tried to learn all of the rapping part, and I think even now I still can recite the verse to If Ya Gettin\\' Down. Sadly, their 2022 album (made by the three of them) was kinda meh.\\n\\nRumor has it that J (leader and rapper) bullied Sean (the youngest one) back then, and Sean left the group prior to their 2001 break-up without telling the other members. At least that\\'s what the now remaining three members are saying. Maybe they deliberately didn\\'t try to get along for the sake of bad boy aesthetic? Idk.\\n\\nmore replies More replies More replies\\n\\nMaybe in early 2000. In early 2000, NSync had hit songs and of course the Timberlake-Britney relationship. In our region in Southeast Asia, its BSB who\\'s number 1, the rest just fighting for number 2. About 5ive, I dont know about them. Take That, Boyzone, 98° and O Town were also popular.\\n\\n5ive is quite a unique group if you like some hip-hop element. I\\'m surprised to see Take That here because they were inactive 1996-2005.\\n\\nMore replies More replies More replies\\n\\nFastest selling album in US only and that\\'s for first week sales. Honestly, that record doesn\\'t meaning anything. It only tells you No Strings Attached sold 2 million in first week, after the first week what happened? lol Overall, No Strings Attached only sold 14 million. Meaning, the \"fastest selling album in first week\" is just a hype. It doesn\\'t mean anything. BSB\\'s Black and Blue sold 1.6 million in its first week in US and 5 million overall if you count international sales for its first week. And its overall sales is 24 million. No Strings Attached is only TOP 6 highest selling album of 2000, BSB on the other hand is TOP 4. lol\\n\\nI\\'m talking about why Nsync might be a close second behind BSB. I never said they surpassed BSB. Like you said, NSA was TOP 6 and B&B was TOP 4, which is impressive for both of them.\\n\\nI read somewhere that some Nsync fans bought multiple copies of No Strings Attached to try to break BSB’s Black & Blue sales record. 😂\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nBecause they both had the same manager who was profiting off of them, but yet were marketed as rivals\\n\\nTalking as someone who’s not from the US, the biggest boybands in the early 00’s (not just in the USA) were 5ive, Westlife, BSB and NSYNC. In my country, those were the boybands that’d be constantly taking the number 1 spot from each other at MTV top 10 or on radios.\\n\\nBSB and NSYNC were both from the US and made the exact same style of music with choreos. Both groups were also manufactured by the same guy and purposely pitted against each other. So, I think that’s where the whole NSYNC vs BSB rivalry originated.\\n\\nWestlife was really popular in most parts of the world but in the US and Canada. They’re still going on as a band, so they’d probably be the best fit to be BSB’s ‘rivals’. However, the way I see it, their style and music are different from BSB. They have great lead vocals and harmonies as BSB does and they have good and fun uptempo songs (some from the past and many more from nowadays) but back in the 00’s they aced the ballads. I honestly also don’t think WL cared that much to get into the whole rivalry thing. Tbh, they’ve usually been drama-free and diplomatic when asked about other boybands.\\n\\nWhen it comes to 5ive, I’m not sure about their popularity in other parts of the world but I guess they were fairly popular. They had great songs but I think their style was also really different from BSB. They had more of the ‘bad boy’ image. Besides, they were European, so they didn’t count as rivals for most ppl in the US. They were more likely to say something bad or make fun about other boybands though 😂.\\n\\nBSB and NSync music is not the same. NSync is more on Electrinic Dance Music and bubble gum pop songs while BSB has more variety in their music. BSB songs range from RnB, pop, rock, EDM, disco-pop, hip-hip, rap etc.\\n\\nI meant it’s the same thing of songs combined with important choreos. Five and wl did some choreos here and there but not at the same level of bsb and nsync. Their style of music didn’t allow that (plus, I don’t think they really wanted to dance that much), whereas bsb and nsync’s music did. In fact, some of the nsync songs were supposed to go to bsb.\\n\\nWestlife is one of the known boy bands of early 2000\\'s, but not in BSB\\'s popularity. In other parts of Europe, Westlife was not well-known even though they are European themselves. Westlife\\'s popularity was only confined in UK and Southeast Asia and some parts of Africa.\\n\\nNo, wl’s popularity was not only confined to those parts of the world. They were popular here in Latin America too. In fact, nsync, bsb, five and wl were the most popular boybands here in Latam.\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nBoyzone, Westlife and 5ive were also big in Australia, not just the UK. Australia is lucky in that regard, despite being far away from Europe and the UK, we get a good range of their music too, not just what is big in the US.\\n\\nYeah, the same happens in most parts of Latin America. I don’t recall the Boyzone era because I was too young but Westlife and 5ive were big, with hundreds of screaming girls following their buses whenever they came here. BSB and NSYNC were also big. I think it’s just the US (and maybe Canada?) that doesn’t seem to care that much about artists from other places. The other day I heard Robbie Williams is not really known in the US, like… what?! Tbh, they’ve missed out on so many great artists!\\n\\nBCS they come from the same vain, literally. The reason why NSYNC was created was specifically to challenge BSB in the market. Chris would have not made NSYNC if he wasn\\'t sidelined when he tried initially joining BSB. They both were managed by the same manager when they started out, both based in Orlando, they both were represented by the same company, and both sued said company, with NSYNC basis on not getting same deals about payment they had with BSB.\\n\\nAnd on top of that, they both by far were the most successful, lets get that straight. Yes, Westlife, Take That and Boyzone existed and were themselves very successful, but the international presences NSYNC had were incomparably. People forget NSYNC were for majority of their existence, more popular outside of the US then in it. They were huge in Europe and Asia, especially in Germany where they started their careers. BSB would be the only band that would be more popular in that regard.\\n\\nBSB made more sales, but they also had more albums. NSYNC managed to get over half their sales with only 3 albums, no other boyband got close to that level of success besides BSB. Not even One Direction had that level of insane sales with such relatively short material.\\n\\nBecause Americans only care about what happens in the good ole U S of A.\\n\\nI hear Disney World\\'s Epcot is a great place to visit to see the world 🤣🤣🤣🤣 No passport needed.\\n\\nTo be fair, Westlife is only popular in limited areas like UK and Southeast Asia and some parts of Africa. And US is the biggest US market so there\\'s that. Me personally I dont like Westlife. Their music is boring and most of their songs sound the same, always pop ballads. They almost always cover songs. I dont even know if they have original songs. lol\\n\\nCool, if you think it\\'s boring. I think they are better than BSB especially the Wild Dreams album. They also don\\'t have any gross members with the Littrell \"beliefs.\" I love pop ballads and those are the BSB songs I also prefer...which is majority of each BSB album. And no, sorry you are clearly miseducated about Westlife not having original songs. Try looking things up before you speak. I don\\'t like their cover albums but there a TON of songs that aren\\'t covers.\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nThis is so weird. I was quite young, but I defo remember Nsync as being much more relevant. I was too small in 1997 (I was 3). But man, in 2000 Nsync was all over the place with Bye Bye Bye and their other tunes. In the early 2000s BSB was just getting a bit irrelevant except for Shape of my heart. Nsync was still doing hits like girlfriend and pop. I think they are both great bands, but they just represent different sub-eras.\\n\\nNot a Chance BSB supremacy bruh\\n\\nThe rivals tho. The achievements in their careers and albums. So NSYNC and BSB has a tie.\\n\\nThere is a huge gap between BSB and NSync in terms career as a boy band.\\n\\nYes, I\\'m in the side of BSB, Ngl But BSB has an impact.\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nWatch the Boy Band Con on You Tube. It’s a documentary on Lou Pearlman. AJ explains it perfectly. They’re the biggest competitor because they were literally designed to be their competitor.\\n\\nThey were both managed by Pearlman and pitted against each other by him (not to mention they became huge around the same time and were very similar groups in terms of sound). And tbf NSYNC disbanded the way they did after Celebrity because Justin obviously made it big as a solo artist after that (and without Justin there was no reason for NSYNC to continue considering he and JC were the voices in that group). Also NSYNC first started because Chris Kirkpatrick auditioned for the BSB and didn\\'t make the cut. That was when Pearlman decided to form a second similar group.\\n\\nResponsible-Wait1378\\n\\nIf you were alive at the time then you’d know they both got famous around the same exact time & were rivals at the same exact time. I hated them both but to say BSB was bigger than *NSYNC is stupid. I lived through this time & Nsync was clearly the superior boy group. Sure BSB has more record sales but they also have a crap ton more albums. If you compare album sales at the time that *NSYNC was around, they got them beat, especially their 2nd album. NSync technically only has 3 real albums compared to BSB 10\\n\\nI dunno what\\'s up with the argument that NSYNC wasn\\'t as popular in the rest of the world. Takes a quick search to know that\\'s not true. Look at the charts. Look at the album sales.\\n\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band#:~:text=Backstreet Boys and NSYNC became,over 100 million records sold.\\n\\nNSYNC sold 70 million records from only 3 albums, Westlife 45 million from 11.\\n\\nBSB reigned supreme from 96-99 and NSYNC from 2000-2001 pretty much all around the world except for the UK/Ireland and maybe a few countries in Asia like Indonesia (where Westlife was more popular).\\n\\nI\\'m from Brazil, NSYNC was WILDLY popular here, way, waaaay more than Westlife... Otown, 5ive, 98 degrees? They\\'re not even in the conversation.\\n\\nTo say Westlife or 5ive or any other boy band came close to BSB/Nsync is just foolish. Granted BSB is the biggest boy band ever, period. But their only true rivalry was NSYNC. Everyone else was eating dust, pure and simple.\\n\\nOn a personal note: I like BSB but NSYNC is my favorite, I like their songs better, JC is arguably the best singer of any boy band ever, and their choreographies are iconic! Best boy band ever imo. You could say I\\'m biased. But then again, numbers don\\'t lie xD\\n\\nStrict_Education4872\\n\\nBefore the \"bye-bye\" song, nsync was considered to be a cheap knock off of the backstreet boys and new kids on the block.\\n\\nStrict_Education4872\\n\\nIt\\'s like comparing led zeppelin to ac dc.\\n\\nLeast-Philosopher110\\n\\nall I know is that Nick Carter and Kevin Richardson were both way hotter than any NSYNC member\\n\\nBSB was always better and the record label knew it and always put more money into BSB. N sync’s budget seemed way lower and it showed in their videos. Both bands were created by the same guy and under same record label. BSB was the first cut and n sync I felt, were the B group and by far. People have said n sync members danced better but i watched two music video of theirs recently, and it was so cheesy. I really had to watch a Bsb video to get the image out of my head. Maybe cuz I was an older teen when Bsb broke out and then in college when n sync broke through, I never paid much attention to n sync cuz they dressed weird and had weird hair. Their voices don’t sound as good to me. I think there was focus on n sync cuz of Britney but bsb were way bigger and watching the videos back as an adult, a much better band that should never be compared to n sync. Even their videos now seem pretty good, some 25 years later, whereas n syncs videos seem so dated.\\n\\nI’m just glad that I like punk rock, David Bowie and Bob Dylan. Lol.\\n\\nI\\'m from the US and Westlife is one of my favorite boy bands!!! Since their first album. But Nsync was definitely a competition for BSB , who remains my favorite.\\n\\nMore posts you may like\\n\\nWelcome to r/kpopthoughts, the friendly community for fans of the Korean music industry and everything within it.

I could appreciate both groups’ music, but I could only care about one of them enough to surf the Web when my computer screen was visible to two coworkers. Looking back, it was probably a lingering effect from my years as a devoted New Kids on the Block fan, which culminated in my high school yearbook being full of classmates wishing me a lifetime of happiness with Jordan Knight. I was a one-group kind of girl.\\n\\nThirteen years later, however, I’m still being asked to choose between Backstreet and ‘N Sync. And today, so are you. Join myself and Dave Karger as we take our turn in the ring for EW.com’s ongoing series of pop culture face-offs. We’ll put it to a vote at the end. Ding. Ding.\\n\\nMandi Bierly (‘N Sync supporter): Okay, Dave, I think we need to set two ground rules: You can only mention once that the Backstreet Boys’ “I Want It That Way” is widely considered to be the best boy band song ever, and I can only mention once that ‘N Sync’s Justin Timberlake is the most talented and successful boy band member since Michael Jackson so therefore I win. Deal?\\n\\nSo let’s start here: I’ll concede that Backstreet has three members who can carry a lead (Nick, Brian, and AJ — sorry, Howie), and ‘N Sync only had Justin and JC. But with the way those two effortlessly traded vocals verse-to-verse, matching emotion or funk, you didn’t need or want anyone else upfront. If JC had the personality, fashion sense, and songwriting skills of Timberlake, he would be a top solo artist today instead of a judge on America’s Best Dance Crew. His voice was equal to Justin’s, and Justin’s is, again, the best since Michael Jackson’s. And as for the backup members (Joey, Chris, and Lance), anyone who saw them sing “I Thought She Knew” a cappella knows their worth.\\n\\nDave Karger (Backstreet Boys partisan): You know I love you, Mandi, but I don’t think it’s too much to ask that more than two fifths of a boy band contributed lead vocals to their songs, do you? And the fact remains that although Brian, Nick, and AJ sang most of the lead parts for the Backstreet Boys, both Howie and Kevin also had the occasional moment in spotlight — most notably on “I Want It That Way,” which, by the way, a very smart lady I know says “is widely considered to be the best boy band song ever.” I couldn’t tell you what Joey, Lance, or Chris’s voices sounded like if I had a gun to my head. When it comes to the ‘N Sync B-team, the fact that an entire SNL skit was built around the fact that Justin couldn’t even remember Chris Kirkpatrick’s name kind of says it all, doesn’t it?\\n\\nBut let’s talk about the music too, while we’re at it. Besides The Song That Shall No Longer Be Named, BSB has “Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,” “Shape of My Heart,” “Drowning,” “As Long As You Love Me,” “I’ll Never Break Your Heart,” lesser-known gems like “Bigger” and “That’s What She Said,” and the crazy awesome current single with the New Kids on the Block, “Don’t Turn Out the Lights.” ‘N Sync had “Bye Bye Bye” and…basically that’s it. ‘N Sync may have broken BSB’s record for most CDs sold in one week, but didn’t you get the feeling that their songs were all Max Martin’s sloppy seconds? Anyone who goes to the NKOTBSB tour (which I might have attended out here in L.A.) can see that the Backstreet Boys are still as shriek-worthy as they were 13 years ago.\\n\\nMB: “‘N Sync had ‘Bye Bye Bye’ and…basically that’s it?” Dave! While “Bye Bye Bye” may be their signature song, their hit list includes (but is not limited to) “Tearin’ Up My Heart,” ranked No. 30 on VH1’s list of the top songs of the ‘90s (ahead of Radiohead’s “Creep”); the Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper “It’s Gonna Be Me” (I refuse to believe you don’t remember the action figure video, sir); “This I Promise You” (the best of their radio ballads); and two killer tracks Timberlake cowrote that transcended the boy band genre and showed where he was headed. He may have brought sexy back solo, but it started with the Grammy-nominated “Gone” and Nelly-featuring “Girlfriend,” the latter produced by the Neptunes, thank you very much. (Oh, and also at 3:44 in this clip of them doing “Digital Get Down” live.)\\n\\nYes, Backstreet is still going strong, and “Don’t Turn Out the Lights” is on my iPod. But they’re still nowhere near the dancers ‘N Sync was even in their gloriously dated “I Want You Back” video (minus Lance, every group has to have one). Plus, ‘N Sync gave us the Justin-Britney drama (and their coordinated denim outfits they wore to the 2001 American Music Awards), a video in which they acted insane (“I Drive Myself Crazy”), a Christmas album with original tunes that didn’t suck (“Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays”), and genuinely hilarious appearances on The Simpsons and in Chili’s commercials. What did the Backstreet Boys give us? Isolated drug and health problems — way less entertaining.\\n\\nDK: Okay, I did love “Tearin’ Up My Heart.” But by and large I struggle to remember any of ‘N Sync’s other songs, while BSB music fills my head on a regular basis. (Which makes me happy, by the way.) I’ll rest my case by stating one simple fact: Between the Backstreet Boys and ‘N Sync, one group still finds it advantageous to be together (and sell out arenas, mind you), while the other is becoming more of a distant memory every year. Now it’s time for EW.com readers to have their say!\\n\\nMB: Right. After I say again that Justin Timberlake is the most talented and successful boy band member since Michael Jackson.

Politicians try to reach across the aisle and forget their differences in order to move the country forward. Impatient bosses listen to a new hire\\'s bold idea. These acts of patience and understanding usually pay off... unless someone is debating *NSYNC versus BSB. We all know *NSYNC is the superior boy band, and if anyone tries to argue differently, tell them \"Bye, Bye, Bye!\"\\n\\n*NSYNC is better than Backstreet Boys. Stop - no matter what you say in defense of Nick Carter and crew, you are wrong. It makes me ill to think there are still folks out there who don\\'t understand why *NSYNC is the best, but if you really need convincing, read on. You will come to see the truth, this I promise you.\\n\\n*NSYNC Had As Many Top Ten Hits As BSB Even Though They Only Released Three Albums\\n\\nPhoto: Jive / Amazon\\n\\nEven with three times the albums, the Backstreet Boys didn\\'t really beat the pants of *NSYNC for the number of singles that charted, did they?\\n\\nIn fact, they both had the same number of songs crack the top 10 in the Billboard Hot 100. Backstreet Boys\\'s six top ten singles sounds pretty great, right? But that\\'s three less hits than they had albums. *NSYNC\\'s six top 10 singles means they never had an album that didn\\'t reach those lofty heights. They also had a number one hit in \"It\\'s Gonna Be Me,\" an achievement Backstreet Boys never matched.\\n\\nMaybe the Backstreet Boys should have quit playing games with the charts?\\n\\n*NSYNC Has Two Of The Fastest Selling Albums Of All Time\\n\\nPhoto: Jive / Amazon\\n\\nSophomore slump? What sophomore slump?\\n\\n*NSYNC\\'s second album, No Strings Attached, set a record for first week sales that didn\\'t just exceed the previous record, it more than doubled it. What was the previous title holder? Backstreet Boys Millennium. Bye bye bye, indeed.\\n\\n*NSYNC managed to hold onto their record for a whopping fifteen years until Adele shattered it in 2015. During all that time, guess what musical act came the closest to beating them? *NSYNC\\'s follow up to No Strings Attached, the aptly named Celebrity, which hit the market in 2001.\\n\\nThat\\'s almost a decade and a half that *NSYNC held the top two spots for fastest albums sales. I guess Backstreet Boys should have spent a little more time on their albums.\\n\\n*NSYNC Created Three Rock-Solid Pop Albums While Backstreet Boys Churned Out Filler\\n\\nPhoto: RCA Records / Amazon\\n\\nIf we\\'re going to talk about which of two bands is better, we need to focus on quality over quantity.\\n\\nBackstreet Boys may have given us a deeper discography with eight studio albums and a live compilation, but *NSYNC skipped the churn and cut three well-crafted albums full of \"pop perfection,\" as Billboard pop editor Erin Strecker put it.\\n\\n*NSYNC embodied the showbiz maxim: always leave them wanting more. \\n\\nA Surprise *NSYNC Reunion Broke The Internet\\'s Mind\\n\\nWhen Justin Timberlake performed at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2013, he was joined by his former bandmates for a medley of their signature songs \"Girlfriend\" and \"Bye Bye Bye\". It wasn\\'t exactly a surprise, as speculation had been rampant, but it hadn\\'t been announced in advance, either.\\n\\nStill, even just the prospect of an *NSYNC reunion had been enough to work up a frenzy of media coverage and Twitter snark. You might imagine that was enough for *NSYNC fandom to get it out of their system, but history repeated itself in 2018 when Timberlake was scheduled to perform a certain halftime show for the first time since a certain incident.\\n\\nThough it\\'s been denied, the speculation of another *NSYNC reunion began before the deal was even finalized.\\n\\nThat\\'s what I call lasting impact.\\n\\n*NSYNC Can Tell You What Month Comes Next\\n\\nThere are some internet memes that are so regular you could set a calendar by them. Every Mean Girls fan remembers October 3rd is the day that Aaron asked Cady what day it was. (It was October 3rd.) Budding Jedi everywhere know that May the 4th will always be with them. And even people who barely remember Miss Congeniality know that April 25th is the perfect date: all you need is a light jacket!\\n\\nBut do you know what happens six days after that perfect date?\\n\\nIf you don\\'t, Justin Timberlake can tell you.\\n\\nThat\\'s right... IT\\'S GONNA BE MAY!\\n\\nBackstreet Boys Couldn\\'t Launch A Career Like Justin Timberlake\\'s\\n\\nPhoto: Antonio García Rodríguez / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY 2.0\\n\\nYou can\\'t really compare the solo careers of each member of both bands, because Justin Timberlake blows them all out of the water. \\n\\nTo be fair, there\\'s some more name recognition on both sides. People might know who Nick Carter and Lance Bass are, but they\\'re not household names the way Justin Timberlake is. Nobody else from either band springboarded quite as high as Justin Timberlake, who has collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas, Snoop Dogg, Rihanna, and even Beyoncé.\\n\\nNick Carter might be a reality-show mainstay, but Justin Timberlake is Oscar-nominated!

We remember the Nineties' definitive boy-band feud. Getty (2)\\n\\nIn the 2015 Backstreet Boys documentary Show \\u2018Em What You\\u2019re Made Of, a single telling scene sums up the strange tension that arose between two of the biggest-selling boy bands of all time.\\n\\n\\u201cIt was almost like a betrayal,\\u201d Kevin Richardson recalled in the doc, looking back at the moment in 1995 when the Boys\\u2019 founder and label CEO Lou Pearlman showed Richardson a VHS recording of the newly formed \\u2018N Sync showcasing their abilities.\\n\\n\\u201cWhen we started out, we were like, \\u2018Yeah, we\\u2019re a team. We\\u2019re gonna take over the world. There\\u2019s nobody like us,'\\u201d he continued. \\u201cThen you find out, \\u2018Well, actually there is somebody like you.'\\u201d\\n\\nIn the mid-Nineties, there was an absence of big-name pop groups marketed to teens. Eighties heartthrobs New Kids on the Block were rocked with post\\u2013Milli Vanilli lip-sync allegations, and even grunge was on the way out, as drug-fueled turmoil led to the loss of the genre\\u2019s biggest star.\\n\\nBut Pearlman, a man with a history of insurance fraud, was inspired by the NKOTB model. He placed an ad in the Orlando Sentinel for vocalists to form a pop group, leading to the founding of Backstreet Boys in 1993. Just as BSB began breaking internationally, however, Pearlman did something unexpected: He created his own boy band\\u2019s stiffest competition.\\n\\n\\u201c[We] used to joke all the time that we were going to turn Orlando into the next Motown, but we were going to call it Snowtown \\u2013 because we weren\\u2019t doing it with R&B acts, we were doing it with pop acts,\\u201d \\u2018N Sync and Backstreet Boys manager Johnny Wright told Rolling Stone in 1998. Wright had once been NKOTB\\u2019s road manager and was brought on to work with Pearlman\\u2019s budding stars.\\n\\n\\u201cI guess you could say Backstreet Boys are the Temptations and \\u2018N Sync are the Four Tops,\\u201d he elaborated.\\n\\nLike BSB, \\u2018N Sync launched in Europe first. They began releasing singles in Germany in 1996 and became megastars across the continent seemingly overnight. It wasn\\u2019t until March of 1998 that the group officially dropped their self-titled debut album in the U.S. \\u2013 a full year after it was released in European markets. They trimmed the original track list \\u2013 which included an a cappella cover of Boston\\u2019s \\u201cMore Than a Feeling\\u201d \\u2013 but it\\u2019s still an album washed in the EuroDance sound favored by their camp of Swedish songwriters and producers.\\n\\nEvery Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term\\n\\nThe 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\n\\nThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\n\\nThe 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History\\n\\nPrior to \\u2018N Sync\\u2018s 1998 release, Backstreet Boys had just cracked the code. While not yet the phenomenon they would become with 1999\\u2019s Millennium, they did make it to Number Four with their self-titled U.S. debut in January 1998. But the market was starting to make space for a second boy band: \\u2018N Sync\\u2019s U.S. debut would finally hit Number Two in October of that year, spurred on by an MTV concert special in July that sent singles like \\u201cI Want You Back\\u201d and \\u201c(God Must Have Spent) a Little More Time on You\\u201d rising up the charts.\\n\\n\\u201cThe ultimate goal was to do it not once but twice,\\u201d Wright said in 1998. \\u201cWith \\u2018N Sync at Number Three in this country, I think we\\u2019ve done that. And, obviously, it\\u2019s caused a problem.\\u201d\\n\\nBackstreet Boys ended up leaving Wright\\u2019s Backstreet Management that fall. During the following few years, both boy bands would end up entangled in lawsuits with Pearlman, claiming misrepresentation and fraud over their lack of earnings. While such legal battles would slow most artists down, by 2000, both groups were at the head of an international pop phenomenon.\\n\\nWhile the two boy bands worked together to fight for the money that was stolen from them, the fans fueled a rivalry. Pearlman, whether accidentally or on purpose, created the Beatles vs. Stones of the new millennium as the groups raced to become bigger than one another.\\n\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s not \\u2018N Sync itself but where \\u2018N Sync comes from that digs me, digs me, digs me \\u2013 and gets me, still to this day,\\u201d Richardson told Rolling Stone in 2000, mirroring the same thing sentiment he would express in the doc. \\u201cI\\u2019d lost my father to cancer. So I looked at Lou like a father figure. But I was na\\u00efve, and he\\u2019s a liar. We\\u2019ll always remember him for helping us get started. But we\\u2019ll also remember him for screwing us blind and building another group behind our backs.\\u201d\\n\\n\\u2018N Sync felt less of that bitterness toward the Backstreet Boys. After all, they did follow their lead. \\u201cPeople try to make a feud out of everything,\\u201d Justin Timberlake told Rolling Stone in 1998. \\u201cAnd we didn\\u2019t see it like that.\\u201d\\n\\nStill, the comparisons were never-ending. On a technical level, Backstreet Boys sold more albums, but \\u2018N Sync created a star even bigger than either boy band in Timberlake. The \\u201crivalry\\u201d also bred more competition, leading to an unprecedented wave of more male vocal groups, like 98 Degrees and the reality-show\\u2013made O-Town. None made it as far and most were also fighting for money Pearlman stole from them.\\n\\n50 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time\\n\\nKelly Clarkson Enters 'Trolls' Land With \\u2019NSync Cover\\n\\nLike all teen movements, the stars and fans grew up. \\u2018N Sync went on \\u201chiatus\\u201d to pursue solo projects, and the Backstreet Boys saw the darker side of fame consume members like AJ McLean, who went to rehab in 2001. Timberlake\\u2019s solo career took off soon after, and the boy bands\\u2019 all-grown-up peers like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera \\u2013 two artists also pitted against each other in a pop feud during that era \\u2013 were eager to show off a less squeaky-clean side of their images.\\n\\nSince the heyday of \\u2018N Sync and the Backstreet Boys, teen-pop eras have come and gone every few years. The Jonas Brothers went fairly unchallenged as their female Disney counterparts grappled over Britney and Christina\\u2019s crowns. Later, One Direction would go head-to-head with the Wanted in a lopsided feud that was as much fan-created as band-perpetuated. More recently, a new crop of boy bands like Why Don\\u2019t We and PrettyMuch have filled the vacuum left by One Direction\\u2019s absence, but a rivalry has yet to fully materialize.\\n\\nTo this day, the \\u2018N Sync\\u2013Backstreet Boys rift continues to define the groups\\u2019 respective legacies. (Recently, the old rivalry was rekindled in decidedly jokey fashion when \\u2018N Sync\\u2019s Joey Fatone claimed that his group could \\u201cprobably kick [Backstreet Boys\\u2019] ass\\u201d in basketball.) And while, back in the day, the artists might not have been thrilled by the competition, like all great celebrity beefs, it only helped to propel each group higher into the pop stratosphere.\\n\\nThe Avett Brothers Musical 'Swept Away' Heads to Broadway This Fall\\n\\nCar\\u00edn Le\\u00f3n Unveils 'Boca Chueca Vol. 1' Tracklist Featuring Kane Brown, Leon Bridges, Bolela\\n\\nShellac's 'To All Trains' Perfectly Balances Steve Albini's Sarcasm With Biting Noise Rock\\n\\nLenny Kravitz Schedules 'Blue Electric Light' Las Vegas Residency\\n\\nVince Staples Launches New Album 'Dark Times' With First Single 'Shame on the Devil'\\n\\nPersonal Achievement\\n\\nLarisha Paul Read more\\n\\nThe Avett Brothers Musical 'Swept Away' Heads to Broadway This Fall\\n\\nCar\\u00edn Le\\u00f3n Unveils 'Boca Chueca Vol. 1' Tracklist Featuring Kane Brown, Leon Bridges, Bolela\\n\\nJulian Assange Allowed to Appeal U.S. Extradition\\n\\nLenny Kravitz Schedules 'Blue Electric Light' Las Vegas Residency\\n\\nThe digital daily newsletter\\n\\nA Cultural Force That\\n\\nTranscends Generations\\n\\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

It is a question that has haunted boy band fans for darn near 20 years. BSB and *N SYNC happen to be two of the most successful pop groups of all time, but because their most dominant runs happened concurrently, the pair of quintets will forever be compared. Looking back on their heydays 15 years later, it\\u2019s easy to love both groups \\u2014 but, inevitably, it\\u2019s just as easy to lean toward one or the other, and pledge an unspoken allegiance to either Backstreet or the asterisk.\\n\\nA Feid and Yandel Surprise Show On The Water, With an Abrupt Ending 05/15/2024\\n\\nSee latest videos, charts and news\\n\\nSee latest videos, charts and news\\n\\nToday, those unspoken allegiances become spoken, as Billboard pop editors Jason Lipshutz and Erin Strecker face off to explain why Backstreet Boys were better than *N SYNC, and vice versa. Whose side are you on? Read the debate and sound off in the comments section below.\\n\\nTop 20 Essential Boy Band Songs | 10 K-Pop Boy Bands You Need To Know \\n\\nJASON: Okay before we begin, Erin, full disclosure: we both wholeheartedly love the music of Backstreet Boys and *N SYNC. I am not an *N SYNC hater in any regard \\u2014 who could ever hate the reason that the name \\u201cChris Kirkpatrick\\u201d is forever burned into our brains? \\u2014 and I know that the shape of your heart is geometrically accustomed to include lots of BSB love. There is no \\u201clast place\\u201d in this competition, only second place.\\n\\nAnd we are both positive that we know which quintet belongs in first place. I know you have no doubt in your mind that *N SYNC was the superior turn-of-the-millennium boy band, in the same way that I cannot fathom giving anyone other than Brian, A.J., Nick, Howie and Kevin the modern boy band crown.\\n\\nI watched MTV\\u2019s Total Request Live every day after school for years beginning at the end of 1998, basking in the mayhem of Times Square and Carson Daly\\u2019s black nail polish. There were big hits that devoured their TRL competition in those first few months \\u2014 \\u201c\\u2026Baby One More Time,\\u201d of course, and I see you, Kid Rock\\u2019s \\u201cBawitdaba\\u201d! \\u2014 but when the video for Backstreet Boys\\u2019 \\u201cI Want It That Way\\u201d came out in April 1999, it felt like the teen-pop tsunami that had been gathering for months had finally crashed ashore.\\n\\nThe word \\u201ciconic\\u201d gets tossed around too much by modern music fans, but everything about the \\u201cI Want It That Way\\u201d song and video felt instantly iconic: that opening couplet, the powder-white suits, the way A.J. lurches his body forward during \\u201cIt\\u2019s too-o-o la-ate!\\u201d, the \\u201cKisses For Kevin\\u201d sign being waved around during the final chorus. Everything about the construction of \\u201cI Want It That Way\\u201d and its video is so simple, so clean, and yet so memorable, that whenever anyone brings up the boy-band era of the late 90\\u2019s/early 00\\u2019s, my mind immediately goes to that one song \\u2014 and by extension, the feeling of watching it on TRL, of the day Millennium came out, of realizing that these dudes were rock stars in a way that 11-year-old me never imagined rock stars could be.\\n\\nSo I guess that\\u2019s where my argument starts: you can keep your \\u201cBye Bye Bye\\u201d and \\u201cIt\\u2019s Gonna Be Me,\\u201d because to me, \\u201cI Want It That Way\\u201d was unequivocally the high point of that boy band era. It\\u2019s the boy band song that people who hate boy bands still admit is pretty great. It\\u2019s my fire; my one desire. Is it not yours, Erin? If not, tell me why.\\n\\nThe Evolution of Boy Bands, From The Osmonds to Zayn Malik: A Timeline\\n\\nERIN: Wow, you\\u2019re really tearin\\u2019 up my heart here, Jason.\\n\\nFirst of all, I want to second your point that we\\u2019re both fans of both bands (and I\\u2019ve had this debate at previous jobs as well). Anyone who isn\\u2019t currently in a 7th grade IM war can admit that the bands are of course very similar, both contributing to the apex of teen pop at the turn of the millennium. SPEAKING OF\\u2026 I rocked out hard to Millennium, and Backstreet Boys was one of the first albums I ever bought. I was pretty sure I was going to marry Nick Carter for a time, so on a deep emotional level I understand where you\\u2019re coming from.\\n\\nBut. BUT. To dub Backstreet Boys the preeminent boy band of the era is a mistake on par with walking out of the house in matching all-denim outfits with your significant other. Sure, *N SYNC didn\\u2019t give their fans as many albums as Backstreet Boys did theirs, but the three they did put out were pop perfection: tight harmonies, catchy choruses, and iconic music videos full of dance moves still so instantly recognizable that one need only move their arm in a horizontal motion across their body while bringing their fingers and thumb together and apart to elicit approval at any bar or karaoke situation in which one might find themselves.\\n\\n*N SYNC showed they were equally adept at stirring ballads (\\u201cGod Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You\\u201d) as well as upbeat dance tracks (\\u201cNo Strings Attached\\u201d). For me, that\\u2019s a significant *N SYNC edge: Backstreet Boys may be able to harmonize with the best of them, but \\u2014 barring the excellent \\u201cEverybody (Backstreet\\u2019s Back)\\u201d \\u2014 their dance tracks fall short. We aren\\u2019t deciding who are the best technical singers, we\\u2019re going for overall impact, and from the costumes to the stage show (THEY PRETENDED TO BE DOCTORS), *NSYNC checks every box.\\n\\n\\u201cI Want It That Way\\u201d is an excellent song, no argument here. But I would argue that its the high point for the band; a level they don\\u2019t get quite as close to again. *N SYNC was able to sustain their incredible run for quite some time, from \\u201cTearin\\u2019 Up My Heart\\u201d to \\u201cIt\\u2019s Gonna Be Me\\u201d to \\u201cPop.\\u201d At this point, quite frankly, all that matters is that you recognize that it\\u2019s just about respect.\\n\\nJASON: \\u201cTheir dance tracks fall short\\u201d??? What about \\u201cWe\\u2019ve Got It Goin\\u2019 On,\\u201d \\u201cThe Call,\\u201d \\u201cLarger Than Life\\u201d? And, sorry, the \\u201cBye Bye Bye\\u201d dance can\\u2019t hold a candle to the \\u201cEverybody (Backstreet\\u2019s Back)\\u201d two-handed body pull.\\n\\nI understand that BSB and *N SYNC each released three albums during the heights of their cultural popularity, but I think there\\u2019s something to be said about the longevity of the Backstreet Boys. Would an *N SYNC tour in 2015 draw more attention than a BSB tour in 2015? No question, because of the prolonged dormancy and Justin Timberlake\\u2019s involvement. However, Backstreet Boys have been steadily entertaining audiences for a decade longer than *N SYNC, and while radio hasn\\u2019t cared about the four albums they\\u2019ve released since 2005, there are some absolute gems in there if you look hard enough, first and foremost the incredible power ballad \\u201cIncomplete.\\u201d\\n\\nNeil Young once sang, \\u201cIt\\u2019s better to burn out than to fade away,\\u201d and while *N SYNC arguably burned brighter than the Backstreet Boys (at least in terms of album sales), Backstreet Boys have kept chugging along without fading away (at least in terms of live performances). BSB still sells out shows! And I know they do so because of their hits from 15 years ago, but they\\u2019ve been putting in the work and delighting people past their prime in a way I cannot help but admire.\\n\\nERIN: I give Backstreet Boys credit for their longevity, but I think the fact that radio hasn\\u2019t cared since 2005 means that the overall quality has waned and their present-day concerts are merely a shadow of their former ones.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re getting into a very intriguing hypothetical here, because this is where the argument gets interesting, right? What would a 2015 *N SYNC look like? (Hopefully a little more exciting than the all-too-brief VMAs reunion of 2013). It\\u2019s impossible to say for sure, but I, for one, would certainly pay to watch Joey Fatone, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, Chris Kirkpatrick and of course Justin Timberlake break out their biggest hits. They were moving in an interesting direction before the indefinite hiatus \\u2014 \\u201cGone\\u201d and other Celebrity songs pointed to a new, mature sound (look what One Direction is currently doing as they grow).\\n\\nIf a fourth *N SYNC album had happened, would it have been more of the same, or would it possibly have taken the best of Justified and FutureSex/LoveSounds and melded that with a group dynamic? I don\\u2019t want to argue for a world where FutureSex/LoveSounds doesn\\u2019t exist (I\\u2019m not a maniac), but it\\u2019s certainly intriguing to think about what an alternate universe with Timberlake and the collaborators he subsequently worked with would do with *N SYNC. It\\u2019s all I\\u2019ve ever wanted.\\n\\nSpeaking of Justin, he\\u2019s the curly blonde Ken doll in the room here. We simply can\\u2019t have a conversation about best boy bands of that era without acknowledging that there was one incredible performer who rose above it all. A consummate showman who is now in a boy band alum stratosphere all by himself, Timberlake\\u2019s star power elevated everything around it, from cheesy music videos to charming interviews \\u2014 even his teenage dream tabloid romance with Britney Spears contributed to a zeitgeist that simply paid more attention to *N SYNC than Backstreet.\\n\\nNumbers aren\\u2019t everything, but I\\u2019ll leave you with one quick stat: Between 2000 and 2009, the top-selling album was The Beatles\\u2019 1. Number 2? No Strings Attached. For a time *N SYNC wasn\\u2019t simply a big thing in pop culture, they were pop culture.\\n\\nJASON: Justin Timberlake is one of my favorite artists, and the first six songs on FutureSex/LoveSounds probably represent the best six-song run on any album released last decade. JC Chasez is someone whose voice, music and hair I will always defend as underrated, and \\u201cBlowin\\u2019 Me Up (With Her Love)\\u201d is for SURE on my wedding playlist. Lance Bass and Joey Fatone starred in On The Line, so they are golden in my eyes. Chris Kirkpatrick? Dreads, the Eminem diss, three first names composing his name. Perfection.\\n\\nThe members of *N SYNC are more singular than the members of Backstreet Boys, there\\u2019s no denying that. But that\\u2019s sort of the point, isn\\u2019t it? BSB have always been a unit \\u2014 they can\\u2019t operate without each other, and those two Kevin-free albums are their worst for a reason. I don\\u2019t necessarily think that a group needs flashy personalities to put on a great show or make great music, and when you listen to the Backstreet Boys harmonize or watch them do their \\u201cBackstreet\\u2019s Back\\u201d dance, there\\u2019s a certain cohesion that remains irreplaceable. *N SYNC songs are more or less just JC Chasez & Justin Timberlake songs, with backing harmonies on the chorus. The five Backstreet Boys balance each other out \\u2014 everything is in its right place, to paraphrase Radiohead.\\n\\nTo respond to your final point \\u2014 it\\u2019s true, No Strings Attached is more massive than any Backstreet Boys album. You know what else though? No Strings Attached has \\u201cDigital Get Down,\\u201d which is the ickiest boy band song this side of \\u201cLiquid Dreams.\\u201d Yuuuuuuuuck.\\n\\nERIN: Don\\u2019t bring up On The Line trying to distract me. I see you, Jason, and I won\\u2019t stand for it.\\n\\nLook, is \\u201cDigital Get Down\\u201d Grammy-worthy? Of course not. But it is an oddly specific throwaway song about a time (the dawn of the Internet age) and place (your house, chatting with your crush). I don\\u2019t want to put too fine a point on it, but did Lance Bass introduce teenage America to sexting? Would Catfish exist if not for this tune? OMG, I HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE HECK BRITNEY SPEARS THINKS OF THIS SONG.\\n\\nIn all seriousness, I guess my final argument is simply that *N SYNC perfected the boy band formula that had been done before and would continue to be done again and again. They had the moves, the cheese, the personalities, the songs (both ballad and dance club-worthy), and zeitgeist-y media attention. By only releasing three full-length albums, they retained a higher quality that the Boys\\u2019 albums began to lose. That *N SYNC eschewed the reunion tour game only allowed them to burn brighter in fans\\u2019 mind, as you say, but it also allows fans remember, untainted, the joy of learning to dance like them, a time where \\u201cBringin Da Noise\\u201d could soundtrack a hangout, and \\u201cThis I Promise You\\u201d could appear on a mixtape from a junior high crush. The music is important, but a perfect boy band is all about the feelings said songs provoke: of hope, of fantasy, of fun. Cue up the opening notes of \\u201cPop\\u201d and you\\u2019re instantly transported back to 2001, ready to take on the world (ideally with Mr. Timberlake by your side).\\n\\nAlso, I mean, in a music video *N SYNC once hung out in a mental hospital (not to mention that time they ran atop a moving train). Game, set, match.\\n\\nJASON: All fair points, but your argument also leads me right back to mine: *N SYNC may had better moves, cooler personalities and tastier cheese, but I think BSB had the better songs, and that it\\u2019s not a particularly close competition.\\n\\nLet\\u2019s break it down album by album, at least for the first three. BSB\\u2019s self-titled album had \\u201cWe\\u2019ve Got It Goin\\u2019 On,\\u201d \\u201cQuit Playing Games (With My Heart),\\u201d \\u201cEverybody (Backstreet\\u2019s Back),\\u201d \\u201cAs Long As You Love Me,\\u201d \\u201cAll I Have to Give\\u201d and \\u201cI\\u2019ll Never Break You Heart.\\u201d Compare that to *N SYNC\\u2019s self-titled, which had \\u201cTearin\\u2019 Up My Heart,\\u201d \\u201cHere We Go,\\u201d \\u201cI Want You Back,\\u201d \\u201c(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You\\u201d and \\u201cI Drive Myself Crazy.\\u201d Both albums are brimming with hits, but come on, Erin. \\u201cAll I Have To Give\\u201d is amazing, and it\\u2019s, like, the fourth best single on Backstreet Boys!\\n\\nThen you have Millennium vs. No Strings Attached. \\u201cI Want It That Way,\\u201d \\u201cLarger Than Life\\u201d and \\u201cShow Me The Meaning of Being Lonely\\u201d vs. \\u201cBye Bye Bye,\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s Gonna Be Me,\\u201d \\u201cThis I Promise You.\\u201d This is a closer competition, but \\u201cI Want It That Way\\u201d is unbeatable, \\u201cLarger Than Life\\u201d is the best classic rock single of 1999 and the \\u201cShow Me The Meaning of Being Lonely\\u201d is the most unintentionally hilarious music video ever made. Game, set, Millennium.\\n\\nThen there\\u2019s Black & Blue vs. Celebrity. Look, \\u201cPop\\u201d is my favorite *N SYNC song, \\u201cGone\\u201d is probably my second-favorite, and \\u201cGirlfriend\\u201d has that red-hot Nelly remix. That trio is pretty tough to top! But here\\u2019s the thing, Erin: \\u201cThe Call,\\u201d from BSB\\u2019s Black & Blue, is better than all of those songs.

They only have like 4 or 5 songs that became popular. They are nowhere near BSB. I keep on seeing *Nsync vs BSB debate in youtube and other social media like its the best battle of boybands they can think of. If they will pit a band against BSB why not Westlife or Boyzone?? Share\\n\\nOpen comment sort options\\n\\nI'm guessing you're from the UK. Westlife and Boyzone have no relevance in North America.\\n\\nNSYNC are BSBs rivals because they were nearly on equal standing in North America. The boyband era essentially lasted from 97-02, with its peak being 99-00. The Backstreet Boys ruled the early part, 97-99. 1999 was their year. Milenium was the highest selling album of 1999. They were the biggest music group in the world.\\n\\nNSYNC actually surpassed BSB in popularity in 00-02. They didn't just have a few hits. \\\"Bye Bye Bye\\\" was arguably the biggest song in 2000. No Strings Attached was the highest selling album of 2000, and outsold Black and Blue. NSYNC also had a year of success after BSB went on hiatus. Celebrity was a big album and BSB had no answer for it. They had the last big boyband hit with \\\"Girlfriend\\\" in 2002. Then Justin Timberlake went on to become a superstar solo artist while Nick's album failed.\\n\\nIn North America, NSYNC were true rivals for BSB. Worldwide, BSB wins no contest. For example, BSB was massive in Japan while NSYNC only had decent success.\\n\\nThis exactly. I couldn't name you a single song by Westlife or Boyzone (hadn't even heard of Boyzone until this post, tbh)\\n\\nThis is exactly why BSB is the biggest boy band. In North America it's BSB vs NSYNC while the rest of the world it's BSB vs Westlife.\\n\\nNope, try Take That at the beginning and 5ive at their peak\\n\\nThat that was never that big outside of the UK and EU. In many parts of the world they're a one hit wonder with Back For Good. 5ive had a few hit songs but never did dominate the scene the way BSB and Westlife did.\\n\\nTrue, but westlife didnt even take half of the level of fame take that did, that's Why I mentioned it\\n\\nmore replies More replies\\n\\nTake That was big in Asia.\\n\\nTake that were the worst band ever and 5ive is irrelevant compared to west life\\n\\nTake That topples Westlife in sales in UK. They are both UK based boy bands. Take That is huge in UK and in Europe.\\n\\nmore replies More replies More replies More replies\\n\\nNot true. Westlife is only popular in United Kingdom and some parts of Asia like Southeast Asia and Africa. In North America such US and Canada and in Oceania like Australia and New Zealand, Westlife is virtually unknown. Actually, even in Europe, Westlife is not well known even though they are European themselves. That's the reason they only hold concerts mostly in UK not in other parts of Europe.\\n\\nWestlife and Boyzone have no relevance in North America.\\n\\nIirc Westlife did released a US version for their debut album, and later tried to get into the US market with World Of Our Own, but boy band craze has already faded by then in the US.\\n\\nHaving said that, I think it's interesting that both BSB and Nsync first gained their popularity in Europe. Or more specifically, was it Germany?\\n\\nEven in Europe specifically in Germany, NSync never came close to BSB's popularity.\\n\\nI'm only referring to the fact that they both released their debut album in Europe before they went home to the US. I'm just presenting a fact and I'm not arguing their popularity.\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nNot true. No Strings Attached only sold 14 million and Black and Blue sold 24 million. No Strings Attached is NOT the number 1 highest album of 2000 like you claimed. Its only number #6. BSB's Black and Blue is number #4 highest selling album of 2000. The number #1 highest selling album of 2000 is Marshall Mathers LP of Eminem.\\n\\nSecondly, NSync was only popular in US, not in the whole North America and certainly not in all other parts of the world. In Canada for example, BSB reigned supreme even in early 2000's. Maybe,in 2000's, NSync had overtaken BSB a little in terms of popularity but that's only in United States.\\n\\nThe biggest song of 2000 is Bye Bye Bye? Maybe in US, but not for the rest of the world.\\n\\nI'm from Asia and the only hits that NSync had were This I Promise You, Its Gotta Be Me and Bye Bye Bye. And NSync was not so popular here. Out of all the 90's and 00's boy bands, its BSB who was the most famous boy band. Most Asians knew about NSync only in early 2000's. Me personally, I thought they were a new boy band of the 2000. I never knew that they were BSB's \\\"rival\\\". Most people don't even know NSync and are just familiar with Justin Timberlake because of Britney Spears. Lol\\n\\nIn US, BSB and NSync were almost on equal standing. But for the rest of the world, its has always been Backstreet Boys who was the biggest boy band in the world, in Asia, North and South America, Europe, Oceania and Africa.\\n\\nImaginaryBenefit8420\\n\\nI always felt Nsync lacked putting out good ALBUMS. The ONLY reason NO strings beat Black and Blue was because of Bye Bye Bye which is pretty much the ONLY song people know them for. Black and Blue was a much better ALBUM as a whole while No strings just had the song of the year on it which is why it was bought more. Backstreet are also the ONLY boy band to be able to chart top in the U.S in 3 different decades which says something! With most artists when they are hot the first time usually that is the MOST success they will see. There are not very many artists or groups that can chart especially number 1 out of their prime!!!\\n\\nTearing up my heart and here we go are bops.\\n\\nI remember dancing bye bye bye as a kid on a cruise ship in 2000. They were huge.\\n\\nNahh bsb has like 30 hits n n sync has like 5\\n\\nI would sad new kids on the block started the Boy band Craze, well before the Backstreet Boys are in Nsync. Furthermore, I think the Beatles are probably the original boy band. Apologies for punctuation, as I was dictating.\\n\\nEqual-Technology4163\\n\\nBorn in \\u201890 so BSB and NSYNC were actual childhood. I would say \\u2014 each had 5 guys. Both formed in Orlando. Both very Disney World esque. Both extremely catchy songs and poppy. I could go on and on!! Oh and wasn\\u2019t NSYNC legit formed to rival them?? Just my 2 cents \\ud83d\\ude06\\n\\nBut their so called \\\"rivalry\\\" is only in US. Outside US, BSB always wins. BSB has no other \\\"rivals\\\" actually. I am from Asia, and I just recently know about BSB-NSync rivalry. Its funny because, 98\\u00b0 and OTown were more popular in Asia than NSync during that time. lol\\n\\nPuzzleheaded-Hair230\\n\\nThe \\u201csuperiority\\u201d of the BS Boys in relation to their *NSYNC \\u201crivals\\u201d (\\ud83d\\ude44) is reflected only commercially, in sales, but not in musical (and choreographic) quality: notice also the vast superiority of *NSYNC [notably through Dr Justin Timberlake\\ud83d\\udc98, Hon DMus (Berklee, 2019)], in the amount and kinds of artistic/musical awards received, especially from MTV, that are determined by experts & connoisseurs, and not by cash registers. \\ud83d\\ude43\\n\\nNot exactly a rivalry behind the scenes. Both bands were developed by Lou Perlman, who saw the potential of nsync after making bank with BSB, and signed them too. Fun fact, both bands eventually sued him for fraud - taking advantage of them (kids) with wild contracts that paid him as manager, producer, and even as a \\u201csixth\\u201d member of the band. Other than those who have gone onto have additional careers (Justin T\\u2026), none of Nsync or BSBs made much money from their success\\u2026\\n\\nTwo words: Lou Pearlman\\n\\nBecause BSB and *NSYNC were the two biggest boybands at the time. The other boybands were nowhere near as popular as those two. And as previously stated, *NSYNC was literally created to rival BSB.\\n\\nNSync was never one of the \\\"biggest\\\" boybands. BSB was the biggest boyband all throughout the world. But in some continent or region, there was a boyband who was considered as BSB's rival. For US, its BSB. In early 2000, in Southeast Asia, its Westlife. In other parts of the world, BSB has no rivals. But interestingly, whoever boy band that was pitted against BSB, BSB always emerges as winners in terms of popularity and sales.\\n\\nStrict_Education4872\\n\\nWhat about New kids on the block?\\n\\nFirst of all No Strings Attached was the fastest selling album in the US (2.4 million in the 1st week iirc), so there's that. But aside from that, I can think of several other reasons:\\n\\nNsync was the only US-based teen pop boy band that became as successful as BSB. Westlife and BoyZone were UK-based; 98 Degrees was more adult contemporary, so they were not directly competing against BSB. O-Town tried to follow the same formula but never became as successful.\\n\\nBSB's music catalogue consisted of both up-tempo tracks and ballads. Westlife and BoyZone were almost entirely ballad-centric. Nsync on the other hand, while most of their songs were up-tempo, they also had some popular ballads, which makes them somewhat 'the best competitor' against BSB.\\n\\nBoth Nsync and BSB had hit singles produced by Max Martin, and both were signed to Jive Records.\\n\\nOr maybe, the record executives simply advertised them as 'the best rival' because that would generate some buzz and boost the sales of both bands.\\n\\nNSYNC was the only US-based boyband that's became as successful as BSB in North America. They're nowhere as popular in the rest of the world. In my part of the world they were on par with 5ive.\\n\\nIn China Nsync was only slightly behind BSB and Westlife, and definitely miles ahead of 5ive.\\n\\n5ive was actually my favorite though, and I did manage to get a couple of my highschool friends into 5ive. Too bad the guys didn't get along very well with each other.\\n\\nThey had great songs! IMO, some of the catchiest ones. Why didn\\u2019t the guys get along? I know they\\u2019re making music again but only three of them.\\n\\nI really loved all three of their albums in the 00s. They were somewhat advertised as the 'bad-boy' boy band, and I think the hip-hop element made them unique. Back in high school I really tried to learn all of the rapping part, and I think even now I still can recite the verse to If Ya Gettin' Down. Sadly, their 2022 album (made by the three of them) was kinda meh.\\n\\nRumor has it that J (leader and rapper) bullied Sean (the youngest one) back then, and Sean left the group prior to their 2001 break-up without telling the other members. At least that's what the now remaining three members are saying. Maybe they deliberately didn't try to get along for the sake of bad boy aesthetic? Idk.\\n\\nmore replies More replies More replies\\n\\nMaybe in early 2000. In early 2000, NSync had hit songs and of course the Timberlake-Britney relationship. In our region in Southeast Asia, its BSB who's number 1, the rest just fighting for number 2. About 5ive, I dont know about them. Take That, Boyzone, 98\\u00b0 and O Town were also popular.\\n\\n5ive is quite a unique group if you like some hip-hop element. I'm surprised to see Take That here because they were inactive 1996-2005.\\n\\nMore replies More replies More replies\\n\\nFastest selling album in US only and that's for first week sales. Honestly, that record doesn't meaning anything. It only tells you No Strings Attached sold 2 million in first week, after the first week what happened? lol Overall, No Strings Attached only sold 14 million. Meaning, the \\\"fastest selling album in first week\\\" is just a hype. It doesn't mean anything. BSB's Black and Blue sold 1.6 million in its first week in US and 5 million overall if you count international sales for its first week. And its overall sales is 24 million. No Strings Attached is only TOP 6 highest selling album of 2000, BSB on the other hand is TOP 4. lol\\n\\nI'm talking about why Nsync might be a close second behind BSB. I never said they surpassed BSB. Like you said, NSA was TOP 6 and B&B was TOP 4, which is impressive for both of them.\\n\\nI read somewhere that some Nsync fans bought multiple copies of No Strings Attached to try to break BSB\\u2019s Black & Blue sales record. \\ud83d\\ude02\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nBecause they both had the same manager who was profiting off of them, but yet were marketed as rivals\\n\\nTalking as someone who\\u2019s not from the US, the biggest boybands in the early 00\\u2019s (not just in the USA) were 5ive, Westlife, BSB and NSYNC. In my country, those were the boybands that\\u2019d be constantly taking the number 1 spot from each other at MTV top 10 or on radios.\\n\\nBSB and NSYNC were both from the US and made the exact same style of music with choreos. Both groups were also manufactured by the same guy and purposely pitted against each other. So, I think that\\u2019s where the whole NSYNC vs BSB rivalry originated.\\n\\nWestlife was really popular in most parts of the world but in the US and Canada. They\\u2019re still going on as a band, so they\\u2019d probably be the best fit to be BSB\\u2019s \\u2018rivals\\u2019. However, the way I see it, their style and music are different from BSB. They have great lead vocals and harmonies as BSB does and they have good and fun uptempo songs (some from the past and many more from nowadays) but back in the 00\\u2019s they aced the ballads. I honestly also don\\u2019t think WL cared that much to get into the whole rivalry thing. Tbh, they\\u2019ve usually been drama-free and diplomatic when asked about other boybands.\\n\\nWhen it comes to 5ive, I\\u2019m not sure about their popularity in other parts of the world but I guess they were fairly popular. They had great songs but I think their style was also really different from BSB. They had more of the \\u2018bad boy\\u2019 image. Besides, they were European, so they didn\\u2019t count as rivals for most ppl in the US. They were more likely to say something bad or make fun about other boybands though \\ud83d\\ude02.\\n\\nBSB and NSync music is not the same. NSync is more on Electrinic Dance Music and bubble gum pop songs while BSB has more variety in their music. BSB songs range from RnB, pop, rock, EDM, disco-pop, hip-hip, rap etc.\\n\\nI meant it\\u2019s the same thing of songs combined with important choreos. Five and wl did some choreos here and there but not at the same level of bsb and nsync. Their style of music didn\\u2019t allow that (plus, I don\\u2019t think they really wanted to dance that much), whereas bsb and nsync\\u2019s music did. In fact, some of the nsync songs were supposed to go to bsb.\\n\\nWestlife is one of the known boy bands of early 2000's, but not in BSB's popularity. In other parts of Europe, Westlife was not well-known even though they are European themselves. Westlife's popularity was only confined in UK and Southeast Asia and some parts of Africa.\\n\\nNo, wl\\u2019s popularity was not only confined to those parts of the world. They were popular here in Latin America too. In fact, nsync, bsb, five and wl were the most popular boybands here in Latam.\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nBoyzone, Westlife and 5ive were also big in Australia, not just the UK. Australia is lucky in that regard, despite being far away from Europe and the UK, we get a good range of their music too, not just what is big in the US.\\n\\nYeah, the same happens in most parts of Latin America. I don\\u2019t recall the Boyzone era because I was too young but Westlife and 5ive were big, with hundreds of screaming girls following their buses whenever they came here. BSB and NSYNC were also big. I think it\\u2019s just the US (and maybe Canada?) that doesn\\u2019t seem to care that much about artists from other places. The other day I heard Robbie Williams is not really known in the US, like\\u2026 what?! Tbh, they\\u2019ve missed out on so many great artists!\\n\\nBCS they come from the same vain, literally. The reason why NSYNC was created was specifically to challenge BSB in the market. Chris would have not made NSYNC if he wasn't sidelined when he tried initially joining BSB. They both were managed by the same manager when they started out, both based in Orlando, they both were represented by the same company, and both sued said company, with NSYNC basis on not getting same deals about payment they had with BSB.\\n\\nAnd on top of that, they both by far were the most successful, lets get that straight. Yes, Westlife, Take That and Boyzone existed and were themselves very successful, but the international presences NSYNC had were incomparably. People forget NSYNC were for majority of their existence, more popular outside of the US then in it. They were huge in Europe and Asia, especially in Germany where they started their careers. BSB would be the only band that would be more popular in that regard.\\n\\nBSB made more sales, but they also had more albums. NSYNC managed to get over half their sales with only 3 albums, no other boyband got close to that level of success besides BSB. Not even One Direction had that level of insane sales with such relatively short material.\\n\\nBecause Americans only care about what happens in the good ole U S of A.\\n\\nI hear Disney World's Epcot is a great place to visit to see the world \\ud83e\\udd23\\ud83e\\udd23\\ud83e\\udd23\\ud83e\\udd23 No passport needed.\\n\\nTo be fair, Westlife is only popular in limited areas like UK and Southeast Asia and some parts of Africa. And US is the biggest US market so there's that. Me personally I dont like Westlife. Their music is boring and most of their songs sound the same, always pop ballads. They almost always cover songs. I dont even know if they have original songs. lol\\n\\nCool, if you think it's boring. I think they are better than BSB especially the Wild Dreams album. They also don't have any gross members with the Littrell \\\"beliefs.\\\" I love pop ballads and those are the BSB songs I also prefer...which is majority of each BSB album. And no, sorry you are clearly miseducated about Westlife not having original songs. Try looking things up before you speak. I don't like their cover albums but there a TON of songs that aren't covers.\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nThis is so weird. I was quite young, but I defo remember Nsync as being much more relevant. I was too small in 1997 (I was 3). But man, in 2000 Nsync was all over the place with Bye Bye Bye and their other tunes. In the early 2000s BSB was just getting a bit irrelevant except for Shape of my heart. Nsync was still doing hits like girlfriend and pop. I think they are both great bands, but they just represent different sub-eras.\\n\\nNot a Chance BSB supremacy bruh\\n\\nThe rivals tho. The achievements in their careers and albums. So NSYNC and BSB has a tie.\\n\\nThere is a huge gap between BSB and NSync in terms career as a boy band.\\n\\nYes, I'm in the side of BSB, Ngl But BSB has an impact.\\n\\nMore replies More replies\\n\\nWatch the Boy Band Con on You Tube. It\\u2019s a documentary on Lou Pearlman. AJ explains it perfectly. They\\u2019re the biggest competitor because they were literally designed to be their competitor.\\n\\nThey were both managed by Pearlman and pitted against each other by him (not to mention they became huge around the same time and were very similar groups in terms of sound). And tbf NSYNC disbanded the way they did after Celebrity because Justin obviously made it big as a solo artist after that (and without Justin there was no reason for NSYNC to continue considering he and JC were the voices in that group). Also NSYNC first started because Chris Kirkpatrick auditioned for the BSB and didn't make the cut. That was when Pearlman decided to form a second similar group.\\n\\nResponsible-Wait1378\\n\\nIf you were alive at the time then you\\u2019d know they both got famous around the same exact time & were rivals at the same exact time. I hated them both but to say BSB was bigger than *NSYNC is stupid. I lived through this time & Nsync was clearly the superior boy group. Sure BSB has more record sales but they also have a crap ton more albums. If you compare album sales at the time that *NSYNC was around, they got them beat, especially their 2nd album. NSync technically only has 3 real albums compared to BSB 10\\n\\nI dunno what's up with the argument that NSYNC wasn't as popular in the rest of the world. Takes a quick search to know that's not true. Look at the charts. Look at the album sales.\\n\\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band#:~:text=Backstreet Boys and NSYNC became,over 100 million records sold.\\n\\nNSYNC sold 70 million records from only 3 albums, Westlife 45 million from 11.\\n\\nBSB reigned supreme from 96-99 and NSYNC from 2000-2001 pretty much all around the world except for the UK/Ireland and maybe a few countries in Asia like Indonesia (where Westlife was more popular).\\n\\nI'm from Brazil, NSYNC was WILDLY popular here, way, waaaay more than Westlife... Otown, 5ive, 98 degrees? They're not even in the conversation.\\n\\nTo say Westlife or 5ive or any other boy band came close to BSB/Nsync is just foolish. Granted BSB is the biggest boy band ever, period. But their only true rivalry was NSYNC. Everyone else was eating dust, pure and simple.\\n\\nOn a personal note: I like BSB but NSYNC is my favorite, I like their songs better, JC is arguably the best singer of any boy band ever, and their choreographies are iconic! Best boy band ever imo. You could say I'm biased. But then again, numbers don't lie xD\\n\\nStrict_Education4872\\n\\nBefore the \\\"bye-bye\\\" song, nsync was considered to be a cheap knock off of the backstreet boys and new kids on the block.\\n\\nStrict_Education4872\\n\\nIt's like comparing led zeppelin to ac dc.\\n\\nLeast-Philosopher110\\n\\nall I know is that Nick Carter and Kevin Richardson were both way hotter than any NSYNC member\\n\\nBSB was always better and the record label knew it and always put more money into BSB. N sync\\u2019s budget seemed way lower and it showed in their videos. Both bands were created by the same guy and under same record label. BSB was the first cut and n sync I felt, were the B group and by far. People have said n sync members danced better but i watched two music video of theirs recently, and it was so cheesy. I really had to watch a Bsb video to get the image out of my head. Maybe cuz I was an older teen when Bsb broke out and then in college when n sync broke through, I never paid much attention to n sync cuz they dressed weird and had weird hair. Their voices don\\u2019t sound as good to me. I think there was focus on n sync cuz of Britney but bsb were way bigger and watching the videos back as an adult, a much better band that should never be compared to n sync. Even their videos now seem pretty good, some 25 years later, whereas n syncs videos seem so dated.\\n\\nI\\u2019m just glad that I like punk rock, David Bowie and Bob Dylan. Lol.\\n\\nI'm from the US and Westlife is one of my favorite boy bands!!! Since their first album. But Nsync was definitely a competition for BSB , who remains my favorite.\\n\\nMore posts you may like\\n\\nWelcome to r/kpopthoughts, the friendly community for fans of the Korean music industry and everything within it.

I could appreciate both groups\\u2019 music, but I could only care about one of them enough to surf the Web when my computer screen was visible to two coworkers. Looking back, it was probably a lingering effect from my years as a devoted New Kids on the Block fan, which culminated in my high school yearbook being full of classmates wishing me a lifetime of happiness with Jordan Knight. I was a one-group kind of girl.\\n\\nThirteen years later, however, I\\u2019m still being asked to choose between Backstreet and \\u2018N Sync. And today, so are you. Join myself and Dave Karger as we take our turn in the ring for EW.com\\u2019s ongoing series of pop culture face-offs. We\\u2019ll put it to a vote at the end. Ding. Ding.\\n\\nMandi Bierly (\\u2018N Sync supporter): Okay, Dave, I think we need to set two ground rules: You can only mention once that the Backstreet Boys\\u2019 \\u201cI Want It That Way\\u201d is widely considered to be the best boy band song ever, and I can only mention once that \\u2018N Sync\\u2019s Justin Timberlake is the most talented and successful boy band member since Michael Jackson so therefore I win. Deal?\\n\\nSo let\\u2019s start here: I\\u2019ll concede that Backstreet has three members who can carry a lead (Nick, Brian, and AJ \\u2014 sorry, Howie), and \\u2018N Sync only had Justin and JC. But with the way those two effortlessly traded vocals verse-to-verse, matching emotion or funk, you didn\\u2019t need or want anyone else upfront. If JC had the personality, fashion sense, and songwriting skills of Timberlake, he would be a top solo artist today instead of a judge on America\\u2019s Best Dance Crew. His voice was equal to Justin\\u2019s, and Justin\\u2019s is, again, the best since Michael Jackson\\u2019s. And as for the backup members (Joey, Chris, and Lance), anyone who saw them sing \\u201cI Thought She Knew\\u201d a cappella knows their worth.\\n\\nDave Karger (Backstreet Boys partisan): You know I love you, Mandi, but I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s too much to ask that more than two fifths of a boy band contributed lead vocals to their songs, do you? And the fact remains that although Brian, Nick, and AJ sang most of the lead parts for the Backstreet Boys, both Howie and Kevin also had the occasional moment in spotlight \\u2014 most notably on \\u201cI Want It That Way,\\u201d which, by the way, a very smart lady I know says \\u201cis widely considered to be the best boy band song ever.\\u201d I couldn\\u2019t tell you what Joey, Lance, or Chris\\u2019s voices sounded like if I had a gun to my head. When it comes to the \\u2018N Sync B-team, the fact that an entire SNL skit was built around the fact that Justin couldn\\u2019t even remember Chris Kirkpatrick\\u2019s name kind of says it all, doesn\\u2019t it?\\n\\nBut let\\u2019s talk about the music too, while we\\u2019re at it. Besides The Song That Shall No Longer Be Named, BSB has \\u201cShow Me the Meaning of Being Lonely,\\u201d \\u201cShape of My Heart,\\u201d \\u201cDrowning,\\u201d \\u201cAs Long As You Love Me,\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll Never Break Your Heart,\\u201d lesser-known gems like \\u201cBigger\\u201d and \\u201cThat\\u2019s What She Said,\\u201d and the crazy awesome current single with the New Kids on the Block, \\u201cDon\\u2019t Turn Out the Lights.\\u201d \\u2018N Sync had \\u201cBye Bye Bye\\u201d and\\u2026basically that\\u2019s it. \\u2018N Sync may have broken BSB\\u2019s record for most CDs sold in one week, but didn\\u2019t you get the feeling that their songs were all Max Martin\\u2019s sloppy seconds? Anyone who goes to the NKOTBSB tour (which I might have attended out here in L.A.) can see that the Backstreet Boys are still as shriek-worthy as they were 13 years ago.\\n\\nMB: \\u201c\\u2018N Sync had \\u2018Bye Bye Bye\\u2019 and\\u2026basically that\\u2019s it?\\u201d Dave! While \\u201cBye Bye Bye\\u201d may be their signature song, their hit list includes (but is not limited to) \\u201cTearin\\u2019 Up My Heart,\\u201d ranked No. 30 on VH1\\u2019s list of the top songs of the \\u201890s (ahead of Radiohead\\u2019s \\u201cCreep\\u201d); the Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper \\u201cIt\\u2019s Gonna Be Me\\u201d (I refuse to believe you don\\u2019t remember the action figure video, sir); \\u201cThis I Promise You\\u201d (the best of their radio ballads); and two killer tracks Timberlake cowrote that transcended the boy band genre and showed where he was headed. He may have brought sexy back solo, but it started with the Grammy-nominated \\u201cGone\\u201d and Nelly-featuring \\u201cGirlfriend,\\u201d the latter produced by the Neptunes, thank you very much. (Oh, and also at 3:44 in this clip of them doing \\u201cDigital Get Down\\u201d live.)\\n\\nYes, Backstreet is still going strong, and \\u201cDon\\u2019t Turn Out the Lights\\u201d is on my iPod. But they\\u2019re still nowhere near the dancers \\u2018N Sync was even in their gloriously dated \\u201cI Want You Back\\u201d video (minus Lance, every group has to have one). Plus, \\u2018N Sync gave us the Justin-Britney drama (and their coordinated denim outfits they wore to the 2001 American Music Awards), a video in which they acted insane (\\u201cI Drive Myself Crazy\\u201d), a Christmas album with original tunes that didn\\u2019t suck (\\u201cMerry Christmas, Happy Holidays\\u201d), and genuinely hilarious appearances on The Simpsons and in Chili\\u2019s commercials. What did the Backstreet Boys give us? Isolated drug and health problems \\u2014 way less entertaining.\\n\\nDK: Okay, I did love \\u201cTearin\\u2019 Up My Heart.\\u201d But by and large I struggle to remember any of \\u2018N Sync\\u2019s other songs, while BSB music fills my head on a regular basis. (Which makes me happy, by the way.) I\\u2019ll rest my case by stating one simple fact: Between the Backstreet Boys and \\u2018N Sync, one group still finds it advantageous to be together (and sell out arenas, mind you), while the other is becoming more of a distant memory every year. Now it\\u2019s time for EW.com readers to have their say!\\n\\nMB: Right. After I say again that Justin Timberlake is the most talented and successful boy band member since Michael Jackson.

Politicians try to reach across the aisle and forget their differences in order to move the country forward. Impatient bosses listen to a new hire's bold idea. These acts of patience and understanding usually pay off... unless someone is debating *NSYNC versus BSB. We all know *NSYNC is the superior boy band, and if anyone tries to argue differently, tell them \\\"Bye, Bye, Bye!\\\"\\n\\n*NSYNC is better than Backstreet Boys. Stop - no matter what you say in defense of Nick Carter and crew, you are wrong. It makes me ill to think there are still folks out there who don't understand why *NSYNC is the best, but if you really need convincing, read on. You will come to see the truth, this I promise you.\\n\\n*NSYNC Had As Many Top Ten Hits As BSB Even Though They Only Released Three Albums\\n\\nPhoto: Jive / Amazon\\n\\nEven with three times the albums, the Backstreet Boys didn't really beat the pants of *NSYNC for the number of singles that charted, did they?\\n\\nIn fact, they both had the same number of songs crack the top 10 in the Billboard Hot 100. Backstreet Boys's six top ten singles sounds pretty great, right? But that's three less hits than they had albums. *NSYNC's six top 10 singles means they never had an album that didn't reach those lofty heights. They also had a number one hit in \\\"It's Gonna Be Me,\\\" an achievement Backstreet Boys never matched.\\n\\nMaybe the Backstreet Boys should have quit playing games with the charts?\\n\\n*NSYNC Has Two Of The Fastest Selling Albums Of All Time\\n\\nPhoto: Jive / Amazon\\n\\nSophomore slump? What sophomore slump?\\n\\n*NSYNC's second album, No Strings Attached, set a record for first week sales that didn't just exceed the previous record, it more than doubled it. What was the previous title holder? Backstreet Boys Millennium. Bye bye bye, indeed.\\n\\n*NSYNC managed to hold onto their record for a whopping fifteen years until Adele shattered it in 2015. During all that time, guess what musical act came the closest to beating them? *NSYNC's follow up to No Strings Attached, the aptly named Celebrity, which hit the market in 2001.\\n\\nThat's almost a decade and a half that *NSYNC held the top two spots for fastest albums sales. I guess Backstreet Boys should have spent a little more time on their albums.\\n\\n*NSYNC Created Three Rock-Solid Pop Albums While Backstreet Boys Churned Out Filler\\n\\nPhoto: RCA Records / Amazon\\n\\nIf we're going to talk about which of two bands is better, we need to focus on quality over quantity.\\n\\nBackstreet Boys may have given us a deeper discography with eight studio albums and a live compilation, but *NSYNC skipped the churn and cut three well-crafted albums full of \\\"pop perfection,\\\" as Billboard pop editor Erin Strecker put it.\\n\\n*NSYNC embodied the showbiz maxim: always leave them wanting more. \\n\\nA Surprise *NSYNC Reunion Broke The Internet's Mind\\n\\nWhen Justin Timberlake performed at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2013, he was joined by his former bandmates for a medley of their signature songs \\\"Girlfriend\\\" and \\\"Bye Bye Bye\\\". It wasn't exactly a surprise, as speculation had been rampant, but it hadn't been announced in advance, either.\\n\\nStill, even just the prospect of an *NSYNC reunion had been enough to work up a frenzy of media coverage and Twitter snark. You might imagine that was enough for *NSYNC fandom to get it out of their system, but history repeated itself in 2018 when Timberlake was scheduled to perform a certain halftime show for the first time since a certain incident.\\n\\nThough it's been denied, the speculation of another *NSYNC reunion began before the deal was even finalized.\\n\\nThat's what I call lasting impact.\\n\\n*NSYNC Can Tell You What Month Comes Next\\n\\nThere are some internet memes that are so regular you could set a calendar by them. Every Mean Girls fan remembers October 3rd is the day that Aaron asked Cady what day it was. (It was October 3rd.) Budding Jedi everywhere know that May the 4th will always be with them. And even people who barely remember Miss Congeniality know that April 25th is the perfect date: all you need is a light jacket!\\n\\nBut do you know what happens six days after that perfect date?\\n\\nIf you don't, Justin Timberlake can tell you.\\n\\nThat's right... IT'S GONNA BE MAY!\\n\\nBackstreet Boys Couldn't Launch A Career Like Justin Timberlake's\\n\\nPhoto: Antonio Garc\\u00eda Rodr\\u00edguez / Wikimedia Commons / CC BY 2.0\\n\\nYou can't really compare the solo careers of each member of both bands, because Justin Timberlake blows them all out of the water. \\n\\nTo be fair, there's some more name recognition on both sides. People might know who Nick Carter and Lance Bass are, but they're not household names the way Justin Timberlake is. Nobody else from either band springboarded quite as high as Justin Timberlake, who has collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas, Snoop Dogg, Rihanna, and even Beyonc\\u00e9.\\n\\nNick Carter might be a reality-show mainstay, but Justin Timberlake is Oscar-nominated! \",\n",
